        "\n",
        "*  The code examples  are typset in `WeBWorK` as though they  appear in  a *terminal*. A terminal displays  the output of  each  command immediately after execution. In a notebook,  when  a cell  is executed, all the  commands are computed and *only*  the  last  value is shown. (The use of `@show` or `print(...)` can be used to display intermediate values in a  cell.)\n",
        "\n",
        "* Copy and paste from a `WeBWorK` page into a notebook will usually be unsuccessful, as  numbers  in the  font  used to display computer markup do not copy as ASCII numbers  into a cell. The numbers can be hand edited though.\n",
        "\n",
        "* While `Julia` is very happy to express its output using scientific notation, `WeBWorK` is not happy to receive the exact output for an answer. Either replace `e` with `E` (as in `1.23e4` would be `1.23E4`) or use decimals.\n",
        "\n",
        "* For *most* questions with a  numeric answer  it is best to  copy all  16 digits of output. Several  digits are expected to match a  correct answer. For numeric questions where an  estimate is made, say from a graph, this is  significantly relaxed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* If the answer  is to  be a function, the  automatic grader is  expecting just  the  rule  of the function  (an expression), as in for `f(x) = sin(x)` just enter `sin(x)`.\n",
