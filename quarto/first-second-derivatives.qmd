This project explores the relationship between a function, $f(x)$ and its first and second derivatives.


The following definitions describe features of functions over an interval:


  * The function $f(x)$ is *positive* on an interval $I=(a,b)$ if $f(x) > 0$ for any $x$ in $(a,b)$.
  * The function $f(x)$ is *increasing* (strictly) on an interval $I=(a,b)$ if $f(x) < f(y)$ whenever $a < x < y < b$.
  * The function $f(x)$ is *concave up* on an interval $I=(a,b)$ if any secant line between values $x$ and $y$ with $a < x < y < b$ lies above the graph of $f(x)$.

## Note
There are similar definitions for *negative*, *decreasing*, and *concave down*.

### Consequences


You may be more familiar with these implications for functions with derivatives:


  * An increasing function will have the property that any secant line connecting $x$ and $y$ with $a < x < y < b$ will have positive slope.
  * An increasing function on $I$ that is differentiable has $f'(x) \geq 0$ on $I$.
  * If $f'(x)$ exists and is positive on $I=(a,b)$, then $f(x)$ is *increasing* on $I$.
  * If $f'(x)$ exists and is increasing on $I=(a,b)$, then $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$.
  * If $f''(x)$ exists and is positive on $I=(a,b)$, then $f'(x)$ is increasing on $I$, and so $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$.


:::{.callout-note}
## Positive and negative
Pay attention to the difference between positive and non-negative. For example, an increasing, differentiable function on *I=(a,b)* is only guaranteed to have a *non-negative* derivative â€“ not a *positive* derivative on *I*.

:::


## Identifying when a function is *positive*

A common task in this subject is identifying where a function is positive, negative, zero, or undefined.

A theoretical tool is the *intermediate value theorem* which can be used to say that a continuous function has only one sign (positive or negative) between adjacent zeros. That is, if $a$ and $b$ are zeros of $f(x)$, a continuous function with say $a < b$ and there is *no* $c$ with $a < c < b$ such that $f(c) = 0$, then $f(x)$ for $x$ in $(a,b)$ is either always positive or always negative.

This gives a technique to identify where a function is *positive*:

* find all the zeros of $f(x)$ and sort them in increasing order
* check the sign  between adjacent zeros at *one* point, a test point (often chosen conveniently to make evaluation easier).
* Also check the sign to the left of the smallest zero and the right of the largest zero by using two test points.

Wherever one of the test points is positive, the interval between the two adjacent zeros will correspond to an interval where the function is positive.

If the function is not continuous, say at a finite set of points, then include the points of discontinuity in the consideration. In fact, only discontinuities where the function jumps over the $y$ axis need consideration.

### Graphically identifying zeros of a function over $[a,b]$


We can graphically identify when a function is positive with the strategy above. Consider the following function over the interval $[-2, 1]$:

$$
f(x) = e^{-x} \cdot (\sin(3x) + \sin(5x)).
$$

A plot shows *roughly* that this function is positive between $-2$ and $-0.8$, save near $-1.57$ where $f$ is $0$ and between $0.0$ and $0.8$.

```{julia}
f(x) = exp(-x) * (sin(3x) + sin(5x))
plot(f, -2, 1)
plot!(zero)
```

The `MTH229` package provides a *convenience* function to color the graph of `f` when a second function, `g` is *nonnegative*, called `plotif`. In this case, we want `g` to be  `f`:

```{julia}
plotif(f, f, -2, 1)
```

The `plotif` function show when `g` is non-negative, not just positive, so wouldn't show a different color for the graph near $-1.57$ where `f` is zero but doesn't cross the $x$ axis.

### Numerically find zeros of a function over $[a,b]$; the `find_zeros` function

We have discussed two means to find zeros of a function $f$:

* when the zero is *between* two values which form a bracketing interval. The zero in the graph above between $-1$ and $-0.5$ is an example. Such zeros are readily identified through *bisection*

* when a zero is *near* a value, such as these four which are near $-1.5$, $-0.75$, $0.0$ and $0.8$. Such zeros may typically be found with *Newton's* method (or `find_zero`)

The `Roots` package, exported with `MTH229`, provides a convenience function, `find_zeros`, which uses bisection or `fzero` to identify *heuristically* all zeros in an interval $[a,b]$. It is easy to use: the interval is specified by pairing off the interval:

```{julia}
find_zeros(f, (-2, 1))  # note the s in find_zeros
```

The algorithm isn't guaranteed to always work the way bisection is, but works fairly well to identify all the zeros execept for cases where there are *many* zeros in the interval or the interval chosen is *too wide*. (A bracketing interval specified to bisection may be infinite, but such wide intervals can be problematic with `find_zeros`, though can work in some cases.)

Here is another example, find the zeros of $f(x) = e^x - x^4$ over $[-10, 10]$:


```{julia}
f(x) = exp(x) - x^4
find_zeros(f, -10, 10)
```

The above also shows the interval can also be specified using two values, as is done with `plot`.

A related problem might be find all zeros of $f(x) = e^x - x^6$. Where should one look to ensure all of the zeros are identified? Too big an interval and the values of $e^x$ will be infinite (numerically) and that may cause problems. Too small an interval and zeros may be excluded. In this case a bit of analysis can help: any zero must be bigger than $-1$, as to the left of $-1$ the exponential is smaller than $1$ and the polynomial bigger than $1$ in absolute value. Further, as exponentials *eventually* dominate polynomials, the interval need not be too large. We could quickly check that $e^{20}$ is bigger than $20^6$ but instead we just try a somewhat larger right limit:

```{julia}
f(x) = exp(x) - x^6
find_zeros(f, (-1, 50))
```


#### Discontinuous function

The algorithm used by `find_zeros` relies on both bisection and a method like Newton's method. The bisection implementation will pick up on places where the function changes sign, even if not continuous. In the example below, the two vertical asymptotes at $3$ and $4$ are found:


```{julia}
f(x) = (x-1)*(x-2) / ((x-3)*(x-4))
zs = find_zeros(f, -10, 10)
```


The values at the `zs` can easily be checked using broadcasting:

```{julia}
f.(zs)  # using the broadcasting syntax -- the dot.
```

Programatically, the `filter` function might be used to screen these out, or in this example a comprehension:

```{julia}
[z for z in zs if abs(f(z)) <= 10]
```

However, for our usage below it is quite helpful that these points are identified.



### The `sign_chart` function

The technique above to find where a function is positive can be automated if `find_zeros` is used to find the zeros. This is done in `sign_chart`.

For example,

```{julia}
f(x) = exp(x) - x^6
sign_chart(f, -1, 20)
```

The output shows how the sign changes at the identified zeros (or other points). In this case we can infer that the function is positive on $(-0.8656\dots, 1.22688869\dots)$ and again on $(16.998887\dots, \infty)$.


Another example,


```{julia}
f(x) = (x-1)*(x-2) / ((x-3)*(x-4))
sign_chart(f, -10, 10)
```

This shows the function is positive on $(-\infty, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, and $(4, \infty)$.


#### Question

How many zeros are found between $-2$ and $1$ for

$$
f(x) = e^{-x/2} \cdot (\sin(11x) + \sin(13x))
$$

```{julia}
#| echo: false
val = length(find_zeros(x -> exp(-x/2)*(sin(11x) + sin(13x)), -2, 1))
numericq(val)
```

#### Question

What is the largest value identified in $[-2,1]$ by `find_zeros` for the function

$$
f(x) = e^{-x/2} \cdot (\sin(11x) + \sin(13x))
$$

```{julia}
#| echo: false
val = maximum(find_zeros(x -> exp(-x/2)*(sin(11x) + sin(13x)), -2, 1))
numericq(val)
```


#### Question

For $f(x) = e^{-x/2} \cdot (\sin(11x) + \sin(13x))$
Consider the output of `sign_chart(f, -2, 1)`. What is the sign of $f$ at $-1$?

```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["positive", "zero", "negative", "undefined"]
answer = 1
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question

Consider $f(x) = e^{-x} \cdot (\sin(3x) + \sin(5x))$ over $[-2, 1]$. What does `sign_chart` identify at the *smallest* zero?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
    "There is a sign change from `+` to `-`",
    "There is a sign change from `-` to `+`",
    "There is no sign change; the function is zero at this point, but doesn't cross the x-axis"]
answer = 3
radioq(choices, answer)
```



## Graphically Identifying increasing, concave up, critical points, ...

As seen, the `plotif` function from the `MTH229` package makes it easy for us to highlight when a function is non negative, as it shows in a separate color when the second function is non-negative.

For example, consider $f(x) =  x^3 - 2x - 1/2$.

This graph shows where $f(x)$ is positive over $(-2,2)$:

```{julia}
f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 1/2
plotif(f, f, -2, 2)
plot!(zero)
```

In this graph, we estimate graphically that the intervals $(-1.2, 0.2)$ and $(1.5, 2)$ are where $f$ is positive within this viewing window.


If we change the screening function to the derivative of $f(x)$, then our graph will show when the function is increasing (or flat):


```{julia}
plotif(f, f', -2, 2)
```

Again, we eyeball from the graph to estimate that this occurs on $(-2, -0.8)$ and $(0.8, 2)$.


Using when the second derivative is non-negative indicates where `f` is concave up:


```{julia}
plotif(f,  f'', -2, 2)
```

We can see the function is concave up on $(0, 2)$.


#### Question


Graphically identify when the function $f(x) = x^x$ is increasing on $(0,2)$


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["(0,2)", "(0.4, 2)"];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Graphically identify when the function $f(x) = \sqrt{|1 - x^2|}$ is increasing on the interval $[-2, 2]$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["(-2, -1) and (0,1)",
	"(-1, 0) and (1, 2)",
	"(-2, 2)"];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Graphically identify when the function $f(x) = x^2 \cdot e^{-x}$ is concave up on the interval $(0,10)$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["(0, 0.6) and (3.5, 10)",
	"(0.6, 3.5)",
	"(0, 2)",
	"(0,10)"];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question

Consider the function below:

```
f(x) = x < -1 ? -x-1 : x > 1 ? x - 1 : 0
```

What does the output of `plotif(f, f', -5, 5)` show?

```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["It shows where `f` is *increasing* only",
	"It shows where `f` is *increasing* or *flat*",
	"It shows where `f` is *flat* only"
]
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

### Numerically finding zeros, critical points, and inflection point candidates

The `find_zeros` function can readily identify when some function is zero (or undefined). It can be used, as seen, to find zeros. However, if passed `f'` it will identify critical points. When passed `f''` it will find when $f''(x) = 0$ (or undefined). Such points are *candidates* for inflection points, though a check on whether the concavity changes is necessary to say such is an inflection point.

In the following we use `scatter!` to show these values on the graph.

```{julia}
f(x) = exp(-x/2) * (sin(3x) + sin(5x))
zs = find_zeros(f, -2, 1)
cps = find_zeros(f', -2, 1)
ips = find_zeros(f'', -2, 1)

plot(f, -2, 1)
scatter!(zs, f.(zs), markercolor="blue", markersize=7)
scatter!(cps, f.(cps), markercolor="red", markersize=3)
scatter!(ips, f.(ips), markercolor="green", markershape=:diamond)
```

An attempt to distinguish the points using color, marker size and shape is made, showing that the value at $-1.5707963267\dots$ is both a zero and a critical point.

The graph also shows that the candidates for inflection points are indeed inflection points. This could also be verified with `sign_chart` where the second derivative changes sign at each:

```{julia}
sign_chart(f'', -2, 1)
```

## Relationships


Suppose we only know indirect things about a function $f(x)$, how much can we say?


We previously mentioned two basic relationships:


> If $f'(x) > 0$ on an interval $(a,b)$ then the function $f(x)$ is *increasing* on $(a,b)$. (It may also increase when $f'(x)=0$, but it isn't guaranteed.)



> If $f''(x) > 0$ on $(a,b)$ then the function $f(x)$ is *concave up* on $(a,b)$.



Similar statements can be made for negative values of the derivative and second derivative.


For example, lets suppose we know that the derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = \exp(x)$. What can we say about $f(x)$ on the interval $(0,4)$?


We make two graphs:


```{julia}
fp(x) = exp(x)
plotif(fp, fp, 0, 4)
```

```{julia}
plotif(fp, fp', 0, 4)
```

From the graphs we see that $f'(x)$ is always *positive* and *increasing*.


From the first fact ($f'(x) > 0$) we know that $f(x)$ is increasing on this interval.


From the second fact ($f'(x)$ is  increasing) we know that $f(x)$ is  concave up on this interval.


Do we know any specific values, or even less ambitiously, when $f(x)$ is positive? The answer must be *no* â€“ we could always add a constant to $f(x)$ and not effect its derivative.


---


Now suppose we have a different $f(x)$. In this case all we know is the second derivative is $f''(x) = x^2 - 2x$. What can we say about $f(x)$ on the interval $(-1,3)$?


A plot to see where the second derivative is positive will show that this $f''(x)$ is positive on $(-1, 0)$ and $(2,3)$:


```{julia}
fpp(x) = x^2 - 2x
plotif(fpp, fpp, -1, 3)
```

This means $f(x)$ is concave up on these same intervals.


Can we tell if our unknown $f(x)$ is increasing? Nope, we have no such ability.  We could always add a term $mx$ to $f(x)$ and keep the same second derivative. So we *can't* tell if the function $f(x)$ is increasing and we *can't* tell where the function $f(x)$ is positive, but we **can** say where it is concave up when we all we know is a second derivative.


#### Question


You know that $f'(x) = |x|$. Over $[-1,1]$ where if $f(x)$ increasing and where is it concave up?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices=[
    "You don't know -- the derivative of |x| does not exist",
	"``f`` is increasing on ``(0,1)`` and concave up on ``(-1,1)``",
    "``f`` is increasing on ``(-1,1)`` and concave up on ``(0,1)``"
];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Suppose $f'(x) = (x^4 - x^2 + 2)/(x^4 - 2x^2 + 1)$. When is $f(x)$ increasing on $(-2, 2)$?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["On (-2, -1) and (0, 1)",
	"On (-1, 1)",
	"Wherever it is defined"];
answer = 3;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


If $f'(x) = \tan(x) - 3x/2$. When is $f(x)$ concave down on the interval $(-\pi/3, \pi/3)$?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
    raw"``(-\pi/3, \pi/3)``",
	raw"``(-0.6, 0.6)``",
	raw"``(-\pi/3, 0)``"
];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

## Classifying critical points


The first- and second-derivative tests are a means to classify if a critical point is also a local extrema. A local extrema will always correspond to a critical point â€“ but not necessarily vice versa. There are two theorems that ensure a critical point will be a local extrema:


> **The first derivative test**
>
> If $c$ is a critical point *and* $f'(x)$ changes sign at $x=c$, then $(c,f( c))$ will be a local extrema. (If the sign change is from positive to negative, it will be a local maximum.) If there is *no* sign change, the critical point is *not* a local extrema.



> **The second derivative test**
>
> If $c$ is a critical point *and* $f''(x) \neq 0$ then $(c,f( c))$ will be a local extrema. If $f''( c) > 0$ this will be a local minimum and if $f''( c) < 0$ a local maximum. (Nothing conclusive can be said when $f''(c)=0$.)



---


For example, let $f(x) = 2\sin(x) + \cos(2x)$. Find all critical points on $[0, 2\pi]$.


As $f(x)$ is everywhere differentiable, these critical points would be where the derivative is $0$. A plot helps us identify how many and roughly where:


```{julia}
#| fig-alt: plot of 2sin(x) + cos(2x) over (0, 2pi)
f(x) = 2sin(x) + cos(2x)
plot(f', 0, 2pi)
```

We see four: one near $0.8$, one near $1.5$, one near $2.5$ and one near $5$.

As explained, we could use `find_zeros` to identify these more precisely:


```{julia}
cps = find_zeros(f', 0, 6)
```

From the graph of `f'` we can see at the first critical point the derivative is changing sign from positive to negative at the first one (hence a local maximum), and this alternates as we go along.

However, we can do this numerically, using the `sign_chart` function.

```{julia}
sign_chart(f', 0, 4)
```

So by the first derivative test we have a max, min, max, min which we see when we plot `f`:


```{julia}
#| fig-alt: plot of f over (0, 2pi)
plot(f, 0, 2pi)
```

To get the same classification from the second derivative test, we evaluate $f''(x)$ at these four critical points:


```{julia}
f''.(cps)
```

Where using the dot broadcasts `f''` over all the values in `cps`.


#### Question


Let $f'(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 1$. Classify all relative extrema of $f(x)$ on the interval $(-1, 1)$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices =[
	"at 0 there is a maximum",
	"Near -1.93185 and 0.51763 there are relative maxima, near 1.93185 and -0.51763 there are relative minima",
	"Near -0.51763 there is a relative minimum, near 0.51763 there is a relative maximum"];
answer = 3;
radioq(choices, answer, keep_order=true)
```

#### Question

choices=["-1 is a relative min and 0.5 is a maximum",
	"-1 is a critical point but not an extram, 0.5 is a relative minimum",
	"This function only has an asymptote at -1, no relative extrema"];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question

    "0 is  relative minimum, 1 is a relative max",
	"0 is a relative maximum, 1 is a relative minimum",
	"both are relative maximum",
	"One can not say from the given information."
];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```
