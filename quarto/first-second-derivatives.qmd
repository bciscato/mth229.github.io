## Introduction


This project explores the relationship between a function, $f(x)$ and its first and second derivatives.


The following definitions describe features of functions over an interval:


  * The function $f(x)$ is *positive* on an interval $I=(a,b)$ if $f(x) > 0$ for any $x$ in $(a,b)$.
  * The function $f(x)$ is *increasing* (strictly) on an interval $I=(a,b)$ if $f(x) < f(y)$ whenever $a < x < y < b$.
  * The function $f(x)$ is *concave up* on an interval $I=(a,b)$ if any secant line between values $x$ and $y$ with $a < x < y < b$ lies above the graph of $f(x)$.

## Note
There are similar definitions for *negative*, *decreasing*, and *concave down*.

### Consequences


You may be more familiar with these implications for functions with derivatives:


  * An increasing function will have the property that any secant line connecting $x$ and $y$ with $a < x < y < b$ will have positive slope.
  * An increasing function on $I$ that is differentiable has $f'(x) \geq 0$ on $I$.
  * If $f'(x)$ exists and is positive on $I=(a,b)$, then $f(x)$ is *increasing* on $I$.
  * If $f'(x)$ exists and is increasing on $I=(a,b)$, then $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$.
  * If $f''(x)$ exists and is positive on $I=(a,b)$, then $f'(x)$ is increasing on $I$, and so $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$.


:::{.callout-note}
## Positive and negative
Pay attention to the difference between positive and non-negative. For example, an increasing, differentiable function on *I=(a,b)* is only guaranteed to have a *non-negative* derivative – not a *positive* derivative on *I*.

## Graphically Identifying positive, increasing, concave up, critical points, ...


We load `MTH229` to provide access to graphing, the `'` notation, and the `plotif` function:


```{julia}
using MTH229
using Plots
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using QuizQuestions
using LaTeXStrings
```

The `plotif` function from the `MTH229` package makes it easy for us to highlight when a function is positive. This function (`plotif(f, g, a, b)`) plots the function $f(x)$ twice over `[a,b]`, the second time doing so only *if* $g(x) \geq 0$.


We can plot when a function is positive by using `f` for `g`. For example, when $f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 1/2$ we make the plot


```{julia}
f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 1/2
plotif(f, f, -2, 2)
```

In this graph, we estimate graphically that the intervals $(-1.2, 0.2)$ and $(1.5, 2)$ are where $f$ is positive within this viewing window.


We can do the same with the derivative, then our graph will show when the function is increasing:


```{julia}
plotif(f, f', -2, 2)
```

Again, we eyeball from the graph to estimate that this occurs on $(-2, -0.8)$ and $(0.8, 2)$.


And of course, using when the second derivative is positive shows where `f` is concave up:


```{julia}
plotif(f,  f'', -2, 2)
```

We can see the function is concave up on $(0, 2)$.


#### Question


Graphically identify when the function $f(x) = x^x$ is increasing on $(0,2)$


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["(0,2)", "(0.4, 2)"];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Graphically identify when the function $f(x) = \sqrt{|1 - x^2|}$ is increasing on the interval $[-2, 2]$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["(-2, -1) and (0,1)",
	"(-1, 0) and (1, 2)",
	"(-2, 2)"];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Graphically identify when the function $f(x) = x^2 \cdot e^{-x}$ is concave up on the interval $(0,10)$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["(0, 0.6) and (3.5, 10)",
	"(0.6, 3.5)",
	"(0, 2)",
	"(0,10)"];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

## Relationships


Suppose we only know indirect things about a function $f(x)$, how much can we say?


We previously mentioned two basic relationships:


> If $f'(x) > 0$ on an interval $(a,b)$ then the function $f(x)$ is *increasing* on $(a,b)$. (It may also increase when $f'(x)=0$, but it isn't guaranteed.)



> If $f''(x) > 0$ on $(a,b)$ then the function $f(x)$ is *concave up* on $(a,b)$.



Similar statements can be made for negative values of the derivative and second derivative.


For example, lets suppose we know that the derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = \exp(x)$. What can we say about $f(x)$ on the interval $(0,4)$?


We make two graphs:


```{julia}
fp(x) = exp(x)
plotif(fp, fp, 0, 4)
```

```{julia}
plotif(fp, fp', 0, 4)
```

From the graphs we see that $f'(x)$ is always *positive* and *increasing*.


From the first fact ($f'(x) > 0$) we know that $f(x)$ is increasing on this interval.


From the second fact ($f'(x)$ is  increasing) we know that $f(x)$ is  concave up on this interval.


Do we know any specific values, or even less ambitiously, when $f(x)$ is positive? The answer must be *no* – we could always add a constant to $f(x)$ and not effect its derivative.


---


Now suppose we have a different $f(x)$. In this case all we know is the second derivative is $f''(x) = x^2 - 2x$. What can we say about $f(x)$ on the interval $(-1,3)$?


A plot to see where the second derivative is positive will show that this $f''(x)$ is positive on $(-1, 0)$ and $(2,3)$:


```{julia}
fpp(x) = x^2 - 2x
plotif(fpp, fpp, -1, 3)
```

This means $f(x)$ is concave up on these same intervals.


Can we tell if our unknown $f(x)$ is increasing? Nope, we have no such ability.  We could always add a term $mx$ to $f(x)$ and keep the same second derivative. So we *can't* tell if the function $f(x)$ is increasing and we *can't* tell where the function $f(x)$ is positive, but we **can** say where it is concave up when we all we know is a second derivative.


#### Question


You know that $f'(x) = |x|$. Over $[-1,1]$ where if $f(x)$ increasing and where is it concave up?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices=[
    "You don't know -- the derivative of |x| does not exist",
	L"f is increasing on $(0,1)$ and concave up on $(-1,1)$",
    L"f is increasing on $(-1,1)$ and concave up on $(0,1)$"
];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Suppose $f'(x) = (x^4 - x^2 + 2)/(x^4 - 2x^2 + 1)$. When is $f(x)$ increasing on $(-2, 2)$?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = ["On (-2, -1) and (0, 1)",
	"On (-1, 1)",
	"Wherever it is defined"];
answer = 3;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


If $f'(x) = \tan(x) - 3x/2$. When is $f(x)$ concave down on the interval $(-\pi/3, \pi/3)$?


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
    raw"``(-\pi/3, \pi/3)``",
	raw"``(-0.6, 0.6)``",
	raw"``(-\pi/3, 0)``"
];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

## Classifying critical points


The first- and second-derivative tests are a means to classify if a critical point is also a local extrema. A local extrema will always correspond to a critical point – but not necessarily vice versa. There are two theorems that ensure a critical point will be a local extrema:


> **The first derivative test**
>
> If $c$ is a critical point *and* $f'(x)$ changes sign at $x=c$, then $(c,f( c))$ will be a local extrema. (If the sign change is from positive to negative, it will be a local maximum.) If there is *no* sign change, the critical point is *not* a local extrema.



> **The second derivative test**
>
> If $c$ is a critical point *and* $f''(x) \neq 0$ then $(c,f( c))$ will be a local extrema. If $f''( c) > 0$ this will be a local minimum and if $f''( c) < 0$ a local maximum. (Nothing conclusive can be said when $f''(c)=0$.)



---


For example, let $f(x) = 2\sin(x) + \cos(2x)$. Find all critical points on $[0, 2\pi]$.


As $f(x)$ is everywhere differentiable, these critical points would be where the derivative is $0$. A plot helps us identify how many and roughly where:


```{julia}
f(x) = 2sin(x) + cos(2x)
plot(f', 0, 2pi)
```

We see four: one near 0.8, one near 1.5, one near 2.5 and one near


5. We use `find_zeros` to identify:


```{julia}
cps = find_zeros(f', 0, 6)
```

Use the first derivative test to classify these values as relative maximum or minimum. From the graph of `f'` we see at the first one the derivative is changing sign from positive to negative at the first one (hence a local maximum), and this alternates as we go along.


The `MTH229` package has a `sign_chart` function to do check numerically for sign changes of a function:


```{julia}
sign_chart(f', 0, 4)
```

So by the first derivative test we have a max, min, max, min which we see when we plot `f`:


```{julia}
plot(f, 0, 2pi)
```

To get the same from the second derivative test, we evaluate $f''(x)$ at these four points:


```{julia}
f''.(cps)
```

(Using the dot broadcasts `f''` over all the values in `cps`.)


If you wanted something fancy, you could convert using `sign`:


```{julia}
["max", "can't tell", "min"][2 .+ Int.(sign.(f''.(cps)))]
```

#### Question


Let $f'(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 1$. Classify all relative extrema of $f(x)$ on the interval $(-1, 1)$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices =[
	"at 0 there is a maximum",
	"Near -1.93185 and 0.51763 there are relative maxima, near 1.93185 and -0.51763 there are relative minima",
	"Near -0.51763 there is a relative minimum, near 0.51763 there is a relative maximum"];
answer = 3;
radioq(choices, answer, keep_order=true)
```

#### Question


Let `fp(x) = (2x-1)/cbrt(x^2 - x - 2)^2`. Over the interval $(-1.5,1.5)$ identify all relative maxima and minima of $f(x)$.


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices=["-1 is a relative min and 0.5 is a maximum",
	"-1 is a critical point but not an extram, 0.5 is a relative minimum",
	"This function only has an asymptote at -1, no relative extrema"];
answer = 2;
radioq(choices, answer)
```

#### Question


Suppose, $f(x)$ has a critical  at $0$ and $1$. If possible, classify them as relative maximum or minimum assuming $f''(x) = 1 - 2x - \sin(x)$


```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [
    "0 is  relative minimum, 1 is a relative max",
	"0 is a relative maximum, 1 is a relative minimum",
	"both are relative maximum",
	"One can not say from the given information."
];
answer = 1;
radioq(choices, answer)
```
