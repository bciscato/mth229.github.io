# Preface {.unnumbered}


## Introduction


MTH229 at the College of Staten Island is a course to introduce a
programming language to reinforce concepts of a first-semester
calculus course from numerical and graphical points of view.

Some sections use the [Julia](http://julialang.org) programming
language. For `Julia`, the computer-lab "projects" are on WeBWorK and
there *should* be sufficient background material therein to work
through the details. IN the notes here can be found additional detail
for those seeking it. For a more thorough introduction, visit
[Calculus with Julia](http://calculuswithjulia.github.io).

Installation details for `Julia` are at the end of this page

----

These  notes are broken into different sections, where most all sections
have some self-grading questions at the end that allow you to test
your knowledge of that material. The code should be copy-and-pasteable
into a `Julia` session. The code output is similar to what would be
shown if evaluated in an `IJulia` cell, our recommended interface while
learning `Julia`, though some may like the `Pluto` interface as well.

The notes mostly follow topics of a standard first-semester
calculus course after some background material is presented for
learning `Julia` within a mathematical framework.

Each topic has a lab project. At CSI, sufficient time is allotted to
complete these projects during the lab class. These projects are
available as `IJulia` notebooks or `Pluto` notebooks. (There are also
`Pluto` notebooks with 5-10 minutes of commentary.) Find links for
these near the top of each page of notes.


For example, blank notebooks for test taking, etc. are found by following these links:

#### Questions and Answers

Question and answers are now presented and completed through  `WeBWorK`.
The  `.ipynb` notebooks  only contain modest background details.

There  are a few idiosyncracies in the `WeBWorK` pages to be aware of:

*  The code examples  are typset in `WeBWorK` as though they  appear in  a *terminal*. A terminal displays  the output of  each  command immediately after execution. In a notebook,  when  a cell  is executed, all the  commands are computed and *only*  the  last  value is shown. (The use of `@show` or `print(...)` can be used to display intermediate values in a  cell.)

* Copy and paste from a `WeBWorK` page into a notebook will usually be unsuccessful, as  numbers  in the  font  used to display computer markup do not copy as ASCII numbers  into a cell. The numbers can be hand edited though.

* While `Julia` is very happy to express its output using scientific notation, `WeBWorK` is not happy to receive the exact output for an answer. Either replace `e` with `E` (as in `1.23e4` would be `1.23E4`) or use decimals.

* For *most* questions with a  numeric answer  it is best to  copy all  16 digits of output. Several  digits are expected to match a  correct answer. For numeric questions where an  estimate is made, say from a graph, this is  significantly relaxed.

* If the answer  is to  be a function, the  automatic grader is  expecting just  the  rule  of the function  (an expression), as in for `f(x) = sin(x)` just enter `sin(x)`.




## Basic ideas

`Julia` makes an excellent choice as a computer supplement for this
material as its syntax is very similar to standard mathematical
syntax. The ability to define mathematical functions using the
familiar `f(x) = ...` notation makes getting started really
easy. Further, the fact that functions are *first-class objects* means
that it is possible to create *higher-order* `Julia` functions that
mirror the standard operations of calculus. The following pattern is
used throughout:

```verbatim
action(function_object, args...)
```

For example, the notes use:

* `plot(f, a, b)` to plot `f` over `[a,b]`; `plot!(g)` to add a curve (using `Plots`)
* `fzero(f, a, b)` or `find_zero(f, (a,b))` to find *a* zero inside the bracketing interval `[a,b]` (from `Roots`)
* `fzeros(f, a, b)` (or `find_zeros(f, (a,b))`) to find *all* the real zeros of a function `f` in `[a,b]` (from `Roots`)
* `fzero(f, a)` (or `find_zero(f, a)`) to find *a* zero using initial starting oint `a` (from `Roots`)
* `limit(f(x), x=>c)` to find the limit of `f` at `c` (from `SymPy`)
* `f'`  to return a function that computes the derivative of `f` (Added in the `MTH229` package based on the `derivative` function from the `ForwardDiff` package)
* `diff(f(x),x)` to find a symbolic derivative of `f` (from `SymPy`)
* `quadgk(f, a, b)` to find the numeric integral of `f` over `(a,b)`
  (from the `QuadGK` package)
* `integrate(f(x), x)` to find the symbolic integral of `f` (from the `SymPy` package)
* `integrate(f(x), (x, a, b))` to find the definite integral over `[a,b]`
  symbolically (from the `SymPy` package).


With just this basic set of actions, akin to buttons on the calculator, a rich variety of problems can be addressed.


## How to use `Julia` in MTH 229


Using `Julia` to complete the projects of MTH 229 can be done in several ways.

### Using the `juliabox` server

CSI students have access to a server that gives access to the jupyter notebooks.

### Installing `Julia` on a personal laptop or computer.

This is not terribly difficult, but does involve a few additional steps:

* Download and install `Julia` from [julialang.org/](https://julialang.org/downloads/). This will install like any other software for you system. You should use the *latest* released version.

* Start the application

This opens a  terminal, appearing as follows:

```{julia}
#| echo: false
Base.banner()
```

Commands are typed after the prompt (`> julia`) and executed when the return key is pressed.


Try a few commands and see. Adding ``2`` and ``2`` should look like:

```
julia> 2 + 2
4

julia>
```


For this class, some external packages must be loaded. First issue the command

```
using MTH229, Plots
```

This installs and loads two external packages -- one containing functions for this class, the other providing a plotting environments.

Once these are installed and loaded, the projects for the class can be
installed following this command:

```
mth229()
```

Okay, that should set everything up.

When you want to actually use `Julia` for this class, you only need to use these two commands from the command line:

```
using IJulia
notebook()
```

If not already installed, `IJulia` will be installed and configured,
and then the `notebook` command will open a browser window allowing
the selection of one of the projects. Your work will be within a browser window, not the terminal.

The latter two commands are the only ones needed for subsequent usage, as the packages `MTH229` and `Plots` will be loaded within an `IJulia` notebook.


#### Using Pluto notebooks locally

`Pluto` notebooks are easier to install. At the terminal (assuming version 1.7 or higher) run:

```
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
```

This will open a `Pluto` landing page in a browser tab.
The html notebooks linked herein offer a means to "Edit or run this notebook." Download the notebook (it will make a `.jl` file) and then open this within `Pluto`.


### Using binder to run the projects  remotely:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mth229/229-projects/HEAD){fig-alt="link to mybinder.org service"}

The link above allows the projects for MTH229 to be run through the web.

* `binder` is a service that runs interactive notebooks through the web. Each notebook is limited in memory and has a 10 minute *inactivity* timeout. Binder notebooks are not persistent, though they do have a button to save to local storage.

Binder takes between 30 seconds and one minute to get up and running. Once a notebook is selected, it takes another 30ish seconds to get the typical packages started.
