    "text": "These projects use version v1.7 of Julia.\n\n (Binder can be used to access Julia remotely.)\n\n\nMTH229 at the College of Staten Island is a course to introduce a programming language to reinforce concepts of a first-semester calculus course from numerical and graphical points of view.\nSome sections use the Julia programming language. For Julia, the computer-lab “projects” are on WeBWorK and there should be sufficient background material therein to work through the details. IN the notes here can be found additional detail for those seeking it. For a more thorough introduction, visit Calculus with Julia.\nInstallation details for Julia are at the end of this page\n\nThese notes are broken into different sections, where most all sections have some self-grading questions at the end that allow you to test your knowledge of that material. The code should be copy-and-pasteable into a Julia session. The code output is similar to what would be shown if evaluated in an IJulia cell, our recommended interface while learning Julia, though some may like the Pluto interface as well.\nThe notes mostly follow topics of a standard first-semester calculus course after some background material is presented for learning Julia within a mathematical framework.\nEach topic has a lab project. At CSI, sufficient time is allotted to complete these projects during the lab class. These projects are available as IJulia notebooks or Pluto notebooks. (There are also Pluto notebooks with 5-10 minutes of commentary.) Find links for these near the top of each page of notes.\nFor example, blank notebooks for test taking, etc. are found by following these links:\nipynb (Pluto html)\n\n\nQuestion and answers are now presented and completed through WeBWorK. The .ipynb notebooks only contain modest background details.\nThere are a few idiosyncracies in the WeBWorK pages to be aware of:\n\nThe code examples are typset in WeBWorK as though they appear in a terminal. A terminal displays the output of each command immediately after execution. In a notebook, when a cell is executed, all the commands are computed and only the last value is shown. (The use of @show or print(...) can be used to display intermediate values in a cell.)\nCopy and paste from a WeBWorK page into a notebook will usually be unsuccessful, as numbers in the font used to display computer markup do not copy as ASCII numbers into a cell. The numbers can be hand edited though.\nWhile Julia is very happy to express its output using scientific notation, WeBWorK is not happy to receive the exact output for an answer. Either replace e with E (as in 1.23e4 would be 1.23E4) or use decimals.\nFor most questions with a numeric answer it is best to copy all 16 digits of output. Several digits are expected to match a correct answer. For numeric questions where an estimate is made, say from a graph, this is significantly relaxed.\nIf the answer is to be a function, the automatic grader is expecting just the rule of the function (an expression), as in for f(x) = sin(x) just enter sin(x).\n\n\n\n\n\nJulia makes an excellent choice as a computer supplement for this material as its syntax is very similar to standard mathematical syntax. The ability to define mathematical functions using the familiar f(x) = ... notation makes getting started really easy. Further, the fact that functions are first-class objects means that it is possible to create higher-order Julia functions that mirror the standard operations of calculus. The following pattern is used throughout:\naction(function_object, args...)\nFor example, the notes use:\n\nplot(f, a, b) to plot f over [a,b]; plot!(g) to add a curve (using Plots)\nfzero(f, a, b) or find_zero(f, (a,b)) to find a zero inside the bracketing interval [a,b] (from Roots)\nfzeros(f, a, b) (or find_zeros(f, (a,b))) to find all the real zeros of a function f in [a,b] (from Roots)\nfzero(f, a) (or find_zero(f, a)) to find a zero using initial starting oint a (from Roots)\nlimit(f(x), x=>c) to find the limit of f at c (from SymPy)\nf' to return a function that computes the derivative of f (Added in the MTH229 package based on the derivative function from the ForwardDiff package)\ndiff(f(x),x) to find a symbolic derivative of f (from SymPy)\nquadgk(f, a, b) to find the numeric integral of f over (a,b) (from the QuadGK package)\nintegrate(f(x), x) to find the symbolic integral of f (from the SymPy package)\nintegrate(f(x), (x, a, b)) to find the definite integral over [a,b] symbolically (from the SymPy package).\n\nWith just this basic set of actions, akin to buttons on the calculator, a rich variety of problems can be addressed.\n\n\n\nUsing Julia to complete the projects of MTH 229 can be done in several ways.\n\n\nCSI students have access to a server that gives access to the jupyter notebooks.\n\n\n\nThis is not terribly difficult, but does involve a few additional steps:\n\nDownload and install Julia from julialang.org/. This will install like any other software for you system. You should use the latest released version, currently v1.8.\nStart the application\n\nThis opens a terminal, appearing as follows:\n\n\n               _\n   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org\n  (_)     | (_) (_)    |\n   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type \"?\" for help, \"]?\" for Pkg help.\n  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |\n  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.7.3 (2022-05-06)\n _/ |\\__'_|_|_|\\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release\n|__/                   |\n\n\n\nCommands are typed after the prompt (> julia) and executed when the return key is pressed.\nTry a few commands and see. Adding 2 and 2 should look like:\njulia> 2 + 2\n4\n\njulia>\nFor this class, some external packages must be loaded. First issue the command\nusing MTH229, Plots\nThis installs and loads two external packages – one containing functions for this class, the other providing a plotting environments.\nOnce these are installed and loaded, the projects for the class can be installed following this command:\nmth229()\nOkay, that should set everything up.\nWhen you want to actually use Julia for this class, you only need to use these two commands from the command line:\nusing IJulia\nnotebook()\nIf not already installed, IJulia will be installed and configured, and then the notebook command will open a browser window allowing the selection of one of the projects. Your work will be within a browser window, not the terminal.\nThe latter two commands are the only ones needed for subsequent usage, as the packages MTH229 and Plots will be loaded within an IJulia notebook.\n\n\nPluto notebooks are easier to install. At the terminal (assuming version 1.7 or higher) run:\nusing Pluto\nPluto.run()\nThis will open a Pluto landing page in a browser tab. The html notebooks linked herein offer a means to “Edit or run this notebook.” Download the notebook (it will make a .jl file) and then open this within Pluto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinder\n\n\nThe link above allows the projects for MTH229 to be run through the web.\n\nbinder is a service that runs interactive notebooks through the web. Each notebook is limited in memory and has a 10 minute inactivity timeout. Binder notebooks are not persistent, though they do have a button to save to local storage.\n\nBinder takes between 30 seconds and one minute to get up and running. Once a notebook is selected, it takes another 30ish seconds to get the typical packages started.\n\nThis table covers pros and cons for the approaches mentioned above:\n                         Using server    Binder       Local Installation\nSetup ease                  ✓              ✓                 ×\n\nSpeed                       ✓              ×                 ✓\n\nPersistence of work         ×              ×                 ✓\n\nFree                        ✓              ✓                 ✓\n\nUse at home                 ✓              ✓                 ✓"

    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe programming language Julia (www.julialang.org) is a new language that builds on a long history of so-called dynamic scripting languages (DSLs). DSLs are widely used for exploratory work and are part of the toolbox of most all data scientists, a rapidly growing area of employment. The basic Julia language is reminiscent of is MATLAB, though it offers many improvements over that language. For these notes, the focus will be on its more transparent syntax, but in general a major selling point of Julia is that it is much faster that MATLAB at many tasks. (Well it should be, MATLAB was started back in the 70s.) Even better, Julia is an open-source project which means it is free to download and install, unlike the commercial package MATLAB.\nThese notes will use Julia to explore calculus concepts. Unlike some other programs used with calculus (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, and Sage) Julia is not a symbolic math language. Rather, we will use a numeric approach. This gives a different viewpoint on the calculus material supplementing that of the text book. Though there are a few idiosyncrasies we will see along the way, for the most part the Julia language will be both powerful and easy to learn.\nIn this project we start with baby steps – how to use Julia to perform operations we can do on the calculator. The use of a calculator requires knowledge about several things we take for granted here:\n\nthe use of the basic math operators\nan understanding of the order of operations, or knowing when parentheses are needed\nhow to use the buttons that compute functions such as the sine function\nand how to use the memory feature to store intermediate computations.\n\nParallells of each of these will be discussed in the following."

With a calculator you “punch” in numbers and operators and to get an answer push the = key. Using Julia is not much different: you type in an expression then send to Julia to compute. The “equals key” on a calculator is replaced by the enter key on the keyboard (or shift-enter if using IJulia). Beyond that there isn’t much difference.\nFor example, to add two and two we simply execute:\n\n2 + 2\n\n4\n\n\nOr to convert \\(70\\) degrees to Celsius with the standard formula \\(C=5/9(F-32)\\):\n\n(5/9)*(70 - 32)\n\n21.11111111111111\n\n\nOf to find a value of \\(32 - 16x^2\\) when \\(x=1.5\\):\n\n32 - 16*(1.5)^2\n\n-4.0\n\n\nTo find the value of \\(\\sqrt{15}\\) we can use power notation:\n\n15^(1/2)\n\n3.872983346207417\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Practice\n\nQuestion\nCompute \\(22/7\\) in Julia.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute \\(\\sqrt{220}\\) in Julia.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute \\(2^8\\) in Julia."

    "section": "1.3 Precedence",
    "text": "1.3 Precedence\nOne drawback about using a calculator is the expression gets evaluated as it gets entered. For simple computations this is a convenience, but for more complicated ones it requires some thinking about the order of how an expression will be computed. In Julia you still need to be mindful of the order that operations are carried out, but as the entire expression is typed – and can be edited – before evaluation, you can more closely control what you want.\nOrder of operations refers to conventions used to decide which operation will happen first, when there is a choice of more than one. A simple example, is what is the value of \\(3 \\cdot 2 + 1\\)?\nThere are two binary operations in this expressions: a multiplication and an addition. Which is done first and which second?\nIn some instances the order used doesn’t matter. A case of this would be \\(3 + 2 + 1\\). This is because addition is associative. (Well, not really on the computer, but that is another lesson.) In the case of \\(3 \\cdot 2 + 1\\) the order certainly matters.\nFor \\(3 \\cdot 2 + 1\\) if we did the addition first, the expression would be \\(9 = 3\\cdot 3\\). If we did the multiplication first, the value would be \\(7=6+1\\). In this case, we all know that the correct answer is \\(7\\), as we perform multiplication before addition, or in more precise terms the precedence of multiplication is higher than that of addition.\n\n1.3.1 Basics of PEMDAS\nThe standard order of the basic mathematical operations is remembered by many students through the mnemonic PEMDAS, which can be misleading, so we spell it out here:\n\n(P) First parentheses\n(E) then exponents (or powers)\n(MD) then multiplication or division\n(AS) then addition or subtraction.\n\nThis has the precedence of multiplication (part of MD) higher than that of subtraction (part of AS), as just mentioned.\nApplying this, if we have the mathematical expression\n\\[\n\\frac{12 - 10}{2}\n\\]\nWe know that the subtraction needs to be done before the division, as this is how we interpret this form of division. How to make this happen? The precedence of parentheses is used to force the subtraction before the division, as in (12-10)/2. Without parentheses you get a different answer:\n\n\n(1.0, 7.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\nUsing a comma to separate expressions will cause both to print out – not just the last one evaluated. This trick is also a useful trick within an IJulia notebook.\n\n\n\nParentheses are used to force lower precedence operations to happen before higher precedence ones.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Same precedence – what to do\nThere is a little more to the story, as we need to understand what happens when we have more then one operation with the same level. For instance, what is \\(2 - 3- 4\\)? Is it \\((2 - 3) - 4\\) or \\(2 - (3 - 4)\\).\nUnlike addition, subtraction is not associative so this really matters. The subtraction operator is left associative meaning the evaluation of \\(2 - 3 - 4\\) is done by \\((2-3) - 4\\). The operations are performed in a left-to-right manner. Most – but not all operations – are left associative, some are right associative and performed in a right-to-left manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\nright to left It is the order of which operation is done first, not reading from right to left, as one might read Arabic.\n\n\nTo see that Julia has left associative subtraction, we can just check.\n\n2 - 3 - 4, (2 - 3) - 4, 2 - (3 - 4)\n\n(-5, -5, 3)\n\n\nNot all operations are processed left-to-right. The power operation, ^, is right associative, as this matches the mathematical usage. For example:\n\n4^3^2, (4^3)^2, 4^(3^2)\n\n(262144, 4096, 262144)\n\n\nWhat about the case where we have different operations with the same precedence? What happens then? A simple example would be \\(2 / 3 * 4\\)? Is this done in a left to right manner as in:\n\n(2 / 3) * 4\n\n2.6666666666666665\n\n\nOr a right-to-left manner, as in:\n\n2 / (3 * 4)\n\n0.16666666666666666\n\n\nAnd the answer is left-to-right:\n\n2 / 3 * 4\n\n2.6666666666666665\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Practice\n\nQuestion\nWich of the following is a valid Julia expression for\n\\[\n\\frac{3 - 2}{4 - 1}\n\\]\nthat uses the least number of parentheses?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (3 - 2) / (4 - 1)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        3 - 2 / (4 - 1)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (3 - 2)/ 4 - 1\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWich of the following is a valid Julia expression for\n\\[\n\\frac{3\\cdot2}{4}\n\\]\nthat uses the least number of parentheses?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        3 * 2 / 4\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (3 * 2) / 4\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWich of the following is a valid Julia expression for\n\\[\n2^{4 - 2}\n\\]\nthat uses the least number of parentheses?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (2 ^ 4) - 2\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        2 ^ (4 - 2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        2 ^ 4 - 2\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nOne of these three expressions will produce a different answer, select that one:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        2 - 3 - 4\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (2 - 3) - 4\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        2 - (3 - 4)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nOne of these three expressions will produce a different answer, select that one:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        2 - 3 * 4\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        2 - (3 * 4)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (2 - 3) * 4\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion Unary operator: the minus sign\nOne of these three expressions will produce a different answer, select that one:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        -1^2\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        (-1)^2\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        -(1^2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute the value of\n\\[\n\\frac{9 - 5 \\cdot (3-4)}{6 - 2}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute the following using Julia:\n\\[\n\\frac{(.25 - .2)^2}{(1/4)^2 + (1/3)^2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute the decimal representation of the following using Julia:\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{2^3} + \\frac{1}{2^4}\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute the following using Julia:\n\\[\n\\frac{3 - 2^2}{4 - 2\\cdot3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nCompute the following using Julia:\n\\[\n(1/2) \\cdot 32 \\cdot 3^2 + 100 \\cdot 3 - 20\n\\]"

    "text": "1.4 Using functions\nMost all calculators used are not limited to these basic arithmetic operations. So-called scientific calculators provide buttons for many of the common mathematical functions, such as exponential, logs, and trigonometric functions. Julia provides these too, of course.\nThere are special functions to perform common powers. For example, the square-root function is used as:\n\nsqrt(15)\n\n3.872983346207417\n\n\nThis shows how to evaluate a function – using its name and parentheses, as in function_name(arguments). Parentheses are also used to group expressions, as would be done to do this using the power notation:\n\n15^(1/2)\n\n3.872983346207417\n\n\nAdditionally, parentheses are also used to make “tuples”, a concept we don’t pursue here but that is important for programming with Julia. The point here is the context of how parentheses are used is important, though for the most part the usage is the same as their dual use in your calculus text.\nLike sqrt, there is also a cube-root function:\n\ncbrt(27)\n\n3.0\n\n\nThe cbrt and sqrt functions are not exactly the same as using ^, as they differ when the inputs are not in their domain: For cube roots, we can see that there is a difference with negative bases:\n\ncbrt(-8)            ## correct\n\n-2.0\n\n\n\n(-8)^(1/3)              ## need first parentheses, why?\n\nLoadError: DomainError with -8.0:\nExponentiation yielding a complex result requires a complex argument.\nReplace x^y with (x+0im)^y, Complex(x)^y, or similar.\n\n\n(The latter is an error as the power function has an output type that depends on the power being real, not a specific value of a real. For 1/2 the above would clearly be an error, so then for 1/3 Julia makes this an error.)\n\n1.4.1 trigonometric functions\nThe basic trigonometric functions in Julia work with radians:\n\nsin(pi/4)\ncos(pi/3)\n\n0.5000000000000001\n\n\nBut students think in degrees. What to do? Well, you can always convert via the ratio \\(\\pi/180\\):\n\nsin(45 * pi/180)\ncos(60 * pi/180)\n\n0.5000000000000001\n\n\nHowever, Julia provides the student-friendly functions sind, cosd, and tand to work directly with degrees:\n\nsind(45)\ncosd(45)\n\n0.7071067811865476\n\n\nBe careful, an expression like \\(\\cos^2(\\pi/4)\\) is a shorthand for squaring the output of the cosine of \\(\\pi/4\\), hence is expressed with\n\ncos(pi/4)^2         # not cos^2(pi/4) !!!\n\n0.5000000000000001\n\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Inverse trigonometric function\nThe math notation \\(\\sin^{-1}(x)\\) is also a source of confusion. This is not a power, rather it indicates an inverse function, in this case the arcsine. The arcsine function is written asin in Julia.\nFor certain values, the arcsine and sine function are inverses:\n\nasin(sin(0.1))\n\n0.1\n\n\nHowever, this isn’t true for all values of \\(x\\), as \\(\\sin(x)\\) is not monotonic everywhere. In particular, the above won’t work for \\(x\\) values outside \\((-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)\\):\n\nasin(sin(100))\n\n-0.5309649148733837\n\n\nOther inverse trigonometric functions are acos, atan and for completeness asec, acsc, and acot are available for use.\n\n\n1.4.3 Exponential and logs\nThe values \\(e^x\\) can be computed through the function exp(x):\n\nexp(2)\n\n7.38905609893065\n\n\nThe constant value of e is only available on demand:\n\nusing Base.MathConstants\ne\n\nℯ = 2.7182818284590...\n\n\nThe logarithm function, log (and not ln) does log base \\(e\\):\n\nlog(exp(2))\n\n2.0\n\n\nTo do base 10, there is a log10 function:\n\nlog10(exp(2))\n\n0.8685889638065036\n\n\nThere is also a log2 function for base 2. However, there are many more possible choices for a base. Rather than create functions for each possible one of interest the log function has an alternative form taking two argument. The first is interpreted as the base, the second the \\(x\\) value. So the above, is also done through:\n\nlog(10, exp(2))\n\n0.8685889638065035\n\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Some useful functions\nThere are some other useful functions For example, abs for the absolute value, round for rounding, floor for rounding down and ceil for rounding up. Here are some examples\n\nround(3.14)\n\n3.0\n\n\n\nfloor(3.14)\n\n3.0\n\n\n\nceil(3.14)\n\n4.0\n\n\nThe observant eye will notice the answers above are not integers. (We discuss how to tell later.) What to do if you want an integer? These functions take a “type” argument, as in rount(Int, 3.14).\n\n\n1.4.5 Practice\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the value of \\(\\sin(\\pi/10)\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the value of \\(\\sin(52^\\circ)\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nIs \\(\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(3\\pi/2))\\) equal to \\(3\\pi/2\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        yes\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        no\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the value of round(3.5000)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the value of sqrt(32 - 12)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich is greater \\(e^\\pi\\) or \\(\\pi^e\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        e^pi\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        pi^e\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the value of \\(\\pi - (x - \\sin(x)/\\cos(x))\\) when \\(x=3\\)?"

    "text": "1.5 Variables\nWith a calculator, one can store values into a memory for later usage. This useful feature with calculators is greatly enhanced with computer languages, where one can bind, or assign, a variable to a value. For example the command x=2 will bind x to the value \\(2\\):\n\nx = 2\n\n2\n\n\nSo, when we evaluate\n\nx^2\n\n4\n\n\nThe value assigned to x is looked up and used to return \\(4\\).\nThe word “dynamic” to describe the Julia language refers to the fact that variables can be reassigned and retyped. For example:\n\nx = sqrt(2) ## a Float64 now\n\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nIn Julia one can have single letter names, or much longer ones, such as\n\nsome_ridiculously_long_name = 3\n\n3\n\n\n\nsome_ridiculously_long_name^2\n\n9\n\n\nThe basic tradeoff being: longer names are usually more expressive and easier to remember, whereas short names are simpler to type. To get a list of the currently bound names, the whos function may be called. Not all names are syntactically valid, for example names can’t begin with a number or include spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\nIn fact, only most objects bound to a name can be arbitrarily redefined. When we discuss functions, we will see that redefining functions can be an issue and new names will need to be used. As such, it often works to stick to come convention for naming: numbers use values like i, j, x, y; functions like f, g, h, etc.\n\n\nTo work with computer languages, it is important to appreciate that the equals sign in the variable assignment is unlike that of mathematics, where often it is used to indicate an equation which may be solved for a value. With the following computer command the right hand expression is evaluated and that value is assigned to the variable. So,\n\nx = 2 + 3\n\n5\n\n\ndoes not assign the expression 2 + 3 to x, but rather the evaluation of that expression, which yields 5. (This also shows that the precedence of the assignment operator is lower than addition, as addition is performed first in the absence of parentheses.)\n\n1.5.1 Multiple assignments\nAt the prompt, a simple expression is entered and, when the return key is pressed, evaluated. At times we may want to work with multiple subexpressions. A particular case might be setting different parameters:\n\na=0\nb=1\n\n1\n\n\nMultiple expressions can be more tersely written by separating each expression using a semicolon:\na=0; b=1;\nNote that Julia makes this task even easier, as one can do multiple assignments via “tuple destructuring:”\n\na, b  = 0, 1        ## printed output is a \"tuple\"\na + b\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Practice\n\nQuestion\nLet \\(a=10\\), \\(b=2.3\\), and \\(c=8\\). Find the value of \\((a-b)/(a-c)\\).\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the answer to this computation?\na = 3.2; b=2.3\na^b - b^a\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nFor longer computations, it can be convenient to do them in parts, as this makes it easier to check for mistakes. (You likely do this with your calculator.)\nFor example, to compute\n\\[\n\\frac{p - q}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\n\\]\nfor \\(p=0.25\\) and \\(q=0.2\\) we might do:\np, q = 0.25, 0.2\ntop = p - q\nbottom = sqrt(p*(1-p))\nanswer = top/bottom\nWhat is the result of the above?"

    "section": "1.6 Numbers",
    "text": "1.6 Numbers\nIn mathematics, there a many different types of numbers. Familiar ones are integers, rational numbers, and the real numbers. In addition, complex numbers are needed to fully discuss polynomial functions. This is not the case with calculators.\nMost calculators treat all numbers as floating point numbers – an approximation to the real numbers. Not so with Julia. Julia has types for many different numbers: Integer, Real, Rational, Complex, and specializations depending on the number of bits that are used, e.g., Int64 and Float64. For the most part there is no need to think about the details, as values are promoted to a common type when used together. However, there are times where one needs to be aware of the distinctions.\n\n1.6.1 Integers and floating point numbers\nIn the real number system of mathematics, there are the familiar real numbers and integers. The integers are viewed as a subset of the real numbers.\nJulia provides types Integer and Real to represent these values. (Actually, the Integer type represents more than one actual storage type, either Int32 or Int64.) These are separate types. The type of an object is returned by typeof().\nFor example, the integer \\(1\\) is simply created by the value 1:\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\nThe floating point value \\(1\\) is specified by using a decimal point:\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n\nThe two values are printed differently – integers never have a decimal point, floating point values always have a decimal point. This emphasizes the fact that the two values 1 and 1.0 are not the same – they are stored differently, they print differently, and can give different answers. In most cases – but not all – uses they can be used interchangeably.\nFor example, we can add the two:\n\n1 + 1.0\n\n2.0\n\n\nThis gives back the floating point value 2.0. First the integer and floating point value are promoted to a common type (floating point in this case) and then added.\nSometimes there can be an issue. The value 2^(-3) we know should be \\(1/2^3 = 1/8\\) or 0.125 and Julia agrees:\n\n2^(-3)\n\n0.125\n\n\nHowever, this is special cased. If -3 is replaced with a variable name, there will be a failure:\n\nx = -3\n2^x\n\nLoadError: DomainError with -3:\nCannot raise an integer x to a negative power -3.\nMake x or -3 a float by adding a zero decimal (e.g., 2.0^-3 or 2^-3.0 instead of 2^-3), or write 1/x^3, float(x)^-3, x^float(-3) or (x//1)^-3\n\n\nThis gotcha has an explanation: in julia, most functions are “type-stable” meaning, the type of the input (integer/integer in this case) should determine the type of the output (in this case floating point). But for this operation to be fast, julia insists (in general) it be an integer, as what happens when the base is non-negative. It is not a “gotcha” when either the exponent or the base is a floating point number:\n\nx = -3\n2.0^x\n\n0.125\n\n\nWhen a computer is used to represent numeric values there are limitations: a computer only assigns a finite number of bits for a value. This works great in most cases, but since there are infinitely many numbers, not all possible numbers can be represented on the computer.\n\nThe first limitation is numbers can not be arbitrarily large.\n\nTake for instance a 64-bit integer. A bit is just a place in computer memory to hold a \\(0\\) or a \\(1\\). Basically one bit is used to record the sign of the number and the remaining 63 to represent the numbers. This leaves the following range for such integers \\(-2^{63}\\) to \\(2^{63} - 1\\).\nJulia is said to not provide training wheels. This means it doesn’t put in checks for integer overflow, as these can slow things down. To see what happens, let just peek:\n\n2^62                ## about 4.6 * 10^18\n2^63                ## negative!!!\n\n-9223372036854775808\n\n\nSo if working with really large values, one must be mindful of the difference – or your bike might crash!\n\nGotchas\nLook at the output of\n\n2^3^4\n\n0\n\n\nWhy is it 0? The value of \\(3^4=81\\) is bigger than 63, so \\(2^{81}\\) will overflow.\nThe following works though:\n\n2.0 ^ 3 ^ 4\n\n2.4178516392292583e24\n\n\nThis is because the value 2.0 will use floating point arithmetic which has a much wider range of values. (The Julia documentation sends you to this interesting blog post johndcook, which indicates the largest floating point value is \\(2^{1023}(2 - 2^{-52})\\) which is roughly 1.8e308.\n\nScientific notation is used to represent many numbers\n\nA number in Julia may be represented in scientific notation. The basic canonical form is \\(a\\cdot 10^b\\), with \\(1 \\leq |a| < 10\\) and \\(b\\) is an integer. This is written in Julia as aeb where e is used to separate the value from the exponent. The value 1.8e308 means \\(1.8 \\cdot 10^{308}\\). Scientific notation makes it very easy to focus on the gross size of a number, as the exponent is set off.\n\nThe second limitation is numbers are often only an approximation.\n\nThis means expressions which are mathematically true, need not be true once approximated on the computer. For example, \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is an irrational number, that is, its decimal representation does not repeat the way a rational number does. Hence it is impossible to store on the computer an exact representation, at some level there is a truncation or round off. This will show up when you try something like:\n\n2 - sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)\n\n-4.440892098500626e-16\n\n\nThat difference of basically \\(10^{-16}\\) is roughly the machine tolerance when representing a number. (One way to imagine this is mathematically, we have two ways to write the number \\(1\\):\n\\[\n0.\\bar{9} = 0.9999... = 1\n\\]\nbut on the computer, you can’t have the “…” in a decimal expansion – it must truncate – so instead values round to something like \\(0.9999999999999999\\) or \\(1\\), with nothing in between.\n\n\nComparing values\nA typical expression in computer languages is to use == to compare the values on the left- and right-hand sides. This is not assignment, rather a question. For example:\n\n2 == 2\n2 == 3\nsqrt(2) * sqrt(2) == 2      ## surprising?\n\nfalse\n\n\nThe last one would be surprising were you not paying attention to the last paragraph. Comparisons with == work well for integers and strings, but not with floating point numbers. (For these the isapprox function can be used.)\nComparisons do a promotion prior to comparing, so even though these numbers are of different types, the == operation treats them as equal:\n\n1 == 1.0\n\ntrue\n\n\nThe === operator has an even more precise notion of equality:\n\n1 === 1.0\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6.2 Scientific notation\nAs mentioned, one can write 3e8 for \\(3 \\cdot 10^8\\), but in fact to Julia the two values 3e8 and 3*10^8 are not quite the same, as one is stored in floating point, and one as an integer. One can use 3.0 * 10.0^8 to get a floating point equivalent to 3e8.\n\nFloating point includes the special values: NaN, Inf. (Not so with integers.)\n\nFloating point contains two special values: NaN and Inf to represent “not a number” and “infinity.” These arise in some natural cases:\n\n1/0             ## infinity. Also -1/0.\n\nInf\n\n\n\n0/0             ## indeterminate\n\nNaN\n\n\nThese values can come up in unexpected circumstances. For example division by \\(0\\) can occur due to round off errors:\n\nx = 1e-17\nx^2/(1-cos(x))          ## should be about 2\n\nInf\n\n\n\n\n1.6.3 Rational numbers\nIn addition to special classes for integer and floating point values, Julia has a special class for rational numbers, or ratios of integers. To distinguish between regular division and rational numbers, Julia has the // symbol to define rational numbers:\n\n1//2\n\n1//2\n\n\n\ntypeof(1//2)\n\nRational{Int64}\n\n\nAs you know, a rational number \\(m/n\\) can be reduced to lowest terms by factoring out common factors. Julia does this to store its rational numbers:\n\n2//4\n\n1//2\n\n\nRational numbers are used typically to avoid round off error when using floating point values. This is easy to do, as Julia will convert them when needed:\n\n1//2 - 5//2                         ## still a rational\n1//2 - sqrt(5)/2                    ## now a floating point\n\n-0.6180339887498949\n\n\nHowever, we can’t do the following, as the numerator would be non-integer when trying to make the rational number:\n\n(1 - sqrt(5)) // 2\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching //(::Float64, ::Int64)\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  //(\u001b[91m::Integer\u001b[39m, ::Integer) at /Applications/Julia-1.7.app/Contents/Resources/julia/share/julia/base/rational.jl:62\n\u001b[0m  //(\u001b[91m::Rational\u001b[39m, ::Integer) at /Applications/Julia-1.7.app/Contents/Resources/julia/share/julia/base/rational.jl:64\n\u001b[0m  //(\u001b[91m::Complex\u001b[39m, ::Real) at /Applications/Julia-1.7.app/Contents/Resources/julia/share/julia/base/rational.jl:78\n\u001b[0m  ...\n\n\n\n\n1.6.4 Complex numbers\nComplex numbers are an extension of the real numbers when the values \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\) is added. Complex numbers have two terms: a real and imaginary part. They are typically written as \\(a + bi\\), though the polar form \\(r\\cdot e^{i\\theta}\\) is also used. The complex numbers have the usual arithmetic operations defined for them.\nIn Julia a complex number may be constructed by the Complex function:\n\nz = Complex(1,2)\n\n1 + 2im\n\n\nWe see that Julia uses im (and not i) for the \\(i\\). It can be more direct to just use this value in constructing complex numbers:\n\nz = 1 + 2im\n\n1 + 2im\n\n\nHere we see that the usual operations can be done:\n\nz^2, 1/z, conj(z)\n\n(-3 + 4im, 0.2 - 0.4im, 1 - 2im)\n\n\nThe value of \\(i\\) comes from taking the square root of \\(-1\\). This is almost true in Julia, but not quite. As the sqrt function will return a real value for any real input, directly trying sqrt(-1.0) will give a DomainError, as in \\(-1.0\\) is not in the domain of the function. However, the sqrt function will return complex numbers for complex inputs. So we have:\n\nsqrt(-1.0 + 0im)\n\n0.0 + 1.0im\n\n\nComplex numbers have a big role to play in higher level mathematics. In calculus, they primarily occur as roots of polynomial equation.\n\n\n1.6.5 Practice\n\nQuestion\nCompute the value of \\(2^{1023}(2 -2^{-52})\\) using 2.0 – not the integer 2:\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        Domain Error\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1.7976931348623157e308\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        -Inf\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe result of sqrt(16) is\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        An integer\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A floating point number\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A rational number (fraction)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe result of 16^2` is\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A rational number (fraction)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        An integer\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A floating point number\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe result of 1/2 is\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A rational number (fraction)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        An integer\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A floating point number\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe result of 2/1 is\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        An integer\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A rational number (fraction)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        A floating point number\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich number is 1.23e4?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        12340\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        12300\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1234\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich number is -43e-2?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        -4.30\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        -43.0\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        -0.43\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the answer to the following:\nval = round(3.4999999999999999);\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n     🎁\n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nIf you need more bits, Julia provides the BigInt and BigFloat classes which give \\(256\\) bits of precision.

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nWe see in this section how to easily create functions in Julia. In the following sections we begin to do things with function, such as learning how to graph functions with Julia.\nFor basic things creating a new function and plotting it is as familiar as this:\nWe begin by loading some packages:\n\nusing MTH229\nusing Plots\n\n[ Info: This package defines `e = exp(1)`\n[ Info: This package overloads the `'` operation for derivatives. This may cause issues with linear algebra usage.\n\n\nThen we define a function and plot it:\n\nf(x) = sin(3x^2 - 2x^3)\nplot(f, 0, pi)\n\n\n\n\nReally, you’d be hard pressed to make this any shorter or more familiar. Of course, not everything is this easy so there are still things to learn, but keep in mind that 90% of what we want to do in these projects is really this straightforward.\nMathematically, a function can be viewed in many different ways. An abstract means is to think of a function as a mapping, assigning to each \\(x\\) value in the function’s domain, a corresponding \\(y\\) value in the function’s range. With computer languages, such as Julia, the same holds, though there may be more than one argument to the function and with Julia the number of arguments and type of each argument are consulted to see exactly which function is to be called.\nHere we don’t work abstractly though. For a mathematical function (real-valued function of a single variable, \\(f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\)), we typically just have some rule for what the function will do to \\(x\\) to produce \\(y\\), such as\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sin(x) - \\cos(x).\n\\]\nIn Julia there are a few different ways to define a function, we start with the most natural one which makes it very simple to work with such functions."

    "section": "2.3 Polynomials and related functions",
    "text": "2.3 Polynomials and related functions\nOne of the most basic families of functions are the polynomial functions, which include as special cases the very familiar constant functions, linear functions and quadratic functions.\nLet’s look at the familiar linear function to convert Fahrenheit into Celsius:\n\\[\nf(x) = 5/9 \\cdot (x - 32).\n\\]\nThat is we subtract \\(32\\) then multiply by \\(5/9\\)\nWe can easily turn this into a function, simply by replacing the mathematical notation \\(\\cdot\\) with *:\n\nf(x) = (5/9) * (x - 32)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis defines a function object f. To evaluate f for a given value of \\(x\\) we simply use the familiar mathematical notation. Here we see what Celsius is for “normal” body temperature:\n\nf(98.6)\n\n37.0\n\n\nAnd the Celsius equivalent to the standard boiling point:\n\nf(212)\n\n100.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\nCalling a function Evaluating a function for a given value is also known in programming languages as “calling” f. When we work with functions in Julia, the distinction between the function object and calling the function is important to keep straight – though not too hard to do. In mathematical notation, it is sort of like the difference between writing \\(f\\) – as opposed to \\(f(x)\\) – to describe the function, the latter implying there is some \\(x\\) to be evaluated, so we think of \\(f(x)\\) as a \\(y\\)-value and \\(f\\) as a function.\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Numeric literals\nJulia provides the familiar notation above for simple functions. In fact, for polynomials with numeric coefficients, one can even skip using * for multiplication:\n\ng(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 2\ng(2)\n\n4\n\n\nThe convention is that when variables are immediately preceded by a numeric literal (and by immediately it is meant no spaces are in between) Julia will assume multiplication is intended. (This can bypass the usual order of operations, e.g. 5/9(x-32) is not 5/9*(x-32).)\nThis can also be used when simple parentheses are involved:\n\nk(x) = 2(x - 1)^2 + 3(x+1)\n\nk (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBut won’t work with expressions such as (x+1)(x-1), as Julia will then think the first parenthetical pair is a function and try to call it with a value of x-1.\n\nExample: Equations versus functions\nMathematically we tend to blur the distinction between the equation\n\\[\ny = 5/9 \\cdot (x - 32)\n\\]\nand the function\n\\[\nf(x) = 5/9 \\cdot (x - 32)\n\\]\nAs the graph of the function \\(f(x)\\) is the same as the graph of the equation \\(y=f(x)\\). There is a distinction in Julia as these commands\n\nx = -40\ny = 5/9 * (x - 32)\n\n-40.0\n\n\nwill evaluate the righthand side with the value of x bound at the time of assignment to y, whereas\n\nf(x) = 5/9 * (x - 32)\nf(72)               ## room temperature\n\n22.22222222222222\n\n\nwill create a function which is called with a value of x at a later time. So the value of x defined when the function is created is not important here (as x is passed in as an argument).\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Rational functions\nRational functions are simply ratios of polynomial functions. Defining them is straightforward. For example.\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 2}{x - 2}\n\\]\nbecomes\n\nf(x) = (x^2 - 2)/(x-2)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nHere, as with your calculator, it is important to remember to use parentheses around the top and bottom expressions, as otherwise the division operator will have higher precedence than the subtraction operators.\n\n\n2.3.3 Other powers\nWhile polynomials use non-negative integer coefficients for the powers, functions with other powers are, of course, possible. The ^ operator is used in general for powers, and the sqrt and cbrt offer an alternative.\nSo, this\n\\[\nf(x) = \\sqrt{x} + x^{1/3} + x^{1/4}\n\\]\ncan become:\n\nf(x) = sqrt(x) + cbrt(x) + x^(1/4)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nFor the fractional power, this shows the required parentheses around (1/4) to ensure that division occurs before the higher-precedence power operation (compare 2^1/4 to 2^(1/4))."

    "text": "2.4 Common functions\nOf course Julia has readily available all the usual built-in functions found on a scientific calculator, and many more. See the section on mathematical operations and functions of the official Julia documentation. In the following, we show how to translate some basic math functions into Julia functions:\n\n2.4.1 Trigonometric functions\n\\[\nf(x) = \\cos(x) - \\sin^2(x)\n\\]\nbecomes\n\nf(x) = cos(x) - sin(x)^2\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout exponents and functions…\n\n\n\nThe conversion from the commonly written form (\\(\\sin^2(x)\\)) to the far less ambiguous \\(\\sin(x)^2\\) is very important. This is necessary with Julia – as it is with calculators – as there is no function sin^2. In Julia, squaring is done on values – not functions, like sin. (And most likely squaring of a function is more likely to be composition, which is not the usage here.) So, to have success, learn to drop the notations \\(\\sin^2(x)\\) or for the arc sine function \\(\\sin^{-1}(x)\\). These shortcuts are best left in the age when mathematics was done just on paper.\n\n\n\nIf you want to work in degrees you can do so with the degree-based trigonometric functions, which follow the same naming pattern save a trailing “d”:\n\nfd(x) = cosd(x) - sind(x)^2\n\nfd (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Inverse trigonometric functions\nA mathematical definition like\n\\[\nf(x) = 2\\tan^{-1}(\\frac{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + x})\n\\]\nbecomes\n\nf(x) = 2atan( sqrt(1-x^2) / (1 + x) )\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis particular function is just an alternative expression for the arc cosine (mathematically \\(\\cos^{-1}\\) but in Julia acos) using the arctan function, as seen here:\n\nf(.5) - acos(.5) ## nearly 0\n\n-2.220446049250313e-16\n\n\nThe exponent in the inverse trigonometric functions is just mathematical notation for the longer expression “arctan” or “arccos”. (It definitely is not a reciprocal.) The Julia functions – like most all computer languages – abbreviate these names to atan, acos or asin.\n\n\n2.4.3 Exponential function\nThe math function\n\\[\nf(x) = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}\n\\]\nCan be expressed as\n\nf(x) = e^(-(1/2)*x^2)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe value of \\(e\\) is built-in to Julia, but not immediately available. It is s exposed by the MTH229 package. But \\(e\\) can be inadvertently redefined. As such, it is a safer practice to use the exp function, as in:\n\nf(x) = exp(-(1/2)*x^2)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThere isn’t much difference in use, but don’t try to do both at once, as in exp^(-(1/2)*x^2)!\n\n\n2.4.4 Logarithms\nThe mathematical notations for logarithms often include \\(\\ln\\) and \\(\\log\\) for natural log and log base 10. With computers, there is typically just log for natural log, or with an extra argument the logarithm to other bases.\n\\[\nf(x) = \\ln(1 - x)\n\\]\nbecomes just\n\nf(x) = log(1 - x)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWhereas, the base 10 log:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\log_{10}(1 + x)\n\\]\ncan be done through:\n\nf(x) = log(10, 1 + x)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nwhere the first argument expresses the base. For convenience, Julia also gives the functions log10 and log2 for base 10 and 2 respectively."

    "section": "2.5 Algebra of functions",
    "text": "2.5 Algebra of functions\nIn mathematics a typical observation is to recognize some object as a combination of simpler objects. For functions, we think of combining simpler functions into more complicated ones. For example, we can think of the sum of functions, \\(h(x) = f(x) + g(x)\\). The rule for each \\(x\\) is simply to add the results of the two rules for \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) applied to \\(x\\). Notationally, we might write this as either:\n\\[\nh = f + g\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nh(x) = f(x) + g(x).\n\\]\nThe former treats \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) as function objects, the latter ties more closely to the concept of a function as a rule that operates on \\(x\\).\nWith Julia the latter representation is more useful for defining combinations of functions. For example, if \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(g(x) = x^2\\), then we can combine these in several ways. The following illustrates several ways to combine the two functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\):\n\nf(x) = sin(x)\ng(x) = x^2\nh(x) = f(x) + g(x)      # f + g\nh(x) = f(x) - g(x)      # f - g\nh(x) = f(x) * g(x)      # f * g\nh(x) = f(x) / g(x)      # f / g\nh(x) = f(x)^g(x)        # f^g\n\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nAll these are based on underlying mathematical operators. In addition, for functions there is the operation of composition, where the output of one function is the input to another. For example:\n\nh(x) = f(g(x))          # f ∘ g or sin(x^2)\nh(x) = g(f(x))          # g ∘ f or (sin(x))^2\n\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis operation is fundamentally non-commutative, as the above example illustrates.\n\n2.5.1 Practice\n\nQuestion\nWhich of these functions will compute \\(\\sin^3(x^2)\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = sin(x^2)^3\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = sin(x^2^3)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = sin^3(x^2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich of these functions will compute\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}?\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = 1/sqrt(2pi) *  exp(-(1/2)*x^2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = 1/(2pi) * exp^(-(1/2)*x^2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = 1/(2pi) * exp(-(1/2)*x^2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nDefine the function \\(f(x) = -16x^2 + 100\\).\nIs \\(f(4)\\) positive?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        yes\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        no\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nDefine the function \\(f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 2\\)\nWhat is the value of \\(f(10)\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nDefine the function \\(f(x) = x^5 + x^4 + x^3\\)\nWhat is the value of \\(f(2)\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich of these functions will compute \\(f(x) = x^2 -2x + 1\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = x^2 + 2*x + 1\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = x^2 - 2x\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich of these functions will compute\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 2x}{x^2 - 3x}?\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = (x^2 - 2x) / x^2 - 3x\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = (x^2 - 2x) / (x^2 - 3x)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = x^2 - 2x / x^2 - 3x\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these functions will compute\n\\[\nf(x) = e^{-x} \\sin(x)?\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = exp(sin(x))\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = exp(-x) * sin(x)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        f(x) = exp(x) * sin(x)"

    "text": "2.7 Functions defined by cases\n\nExample Hockey-stick functions\nHere is a different example, where we define a “hockey stick” function, a name for functions that are flat then increase linearly after some threshold.\nAn old-school cell-phone plan might cost $30 for the first 500 minutes of calling and 25 cents per minute thereafter. Represent this as a function of the number of minutes used.\nHere we need to do one of two things depending if \\(x\\) is greater or less than \\(500\\). There are different ways to do this, here we use an if-else-end statement, which takes the following form:\n\nfunction cell_phone(x)\n     if x < 500\n       return(30.0)\n     else\n       return(30.0 + 0.25*(x-500))\n     end\nend\n\ncell_phone (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nTo see what it would cost to talk for 720 minutes in a month, we have:\n\ncell_phone(720)\n\n85.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA subtlety\n\n\n\nWe return 30.0 above – and not the integer 30 – when \\(x<500\\) so that the function always returns a floating point value and not an integer if less than 0 and a floating point value if bigger. In general it is a good programming practice to have functions return only one type of variable for a given type of input. In this case, as the answer could be real-valued – and not just integer-valued, we want to return floating point values.\n\n\nA quick plot will show why the above function is called a “hockey stick” function:\n\nplot(cell_phone, 0, 1000)\n\n\n\n\nWhen functions that have different rules based on the specific value of \\(x\\) that is input, the use “cases” notation is common. For example,\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\cos(x) & x \\geq 0\\\\\n1 - e^{-1/x^2} & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nTranslating this notation to Julia can also be done with the if-else-end construct:\n\nfunction f(x)\n  if x >= 0\n    cos(x)\n  else\n    1 - exp(-1/x^2)\n  end\nend\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe expression after if is a Boolean value (a true or false value). In these examples they are generated through the Boolean operators, which include the familiar comparison symbols <, <=, ==, >=, and >. (Only == takes learning, as double equal signs are used for comparison, a single one is for assignment.)\n\n\n2.7.1 The “ternary operator”, a simple alternative to if-else-end\nOne can use the so-called ternary operator a ? b : c for simple if-else-end statements as above.\nBasically, a ? b : c is the same as the more verbose\nif a\n   b\nelse\n   c\nend\nSo the cell-phone example could have been a one-liner:\n\ncell_phone(x) = x < 500 ? 30.0 : 30.0 + 0.25*(x - 500)\n\ncell_phone (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWhen x < 500 the expression right after ? is evaluated, and if not, the expression after : is.\nFor mathematical functions, the directness of the ternary operator usually makes it a preferred choice over if-else-end.\n\nExample: Nesting the ternary operator\nIt can be convenient to nest ternary operators. In particular, when the cases involve have more than 2 possibilities. The following does something depending on whether x is positive, negative or zero:\n\nheaviside(x) = x > 0 ? 1.0 : x == 0.0 ? 0.0 : -1.0\n\nheaviside (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThat is a mess to read, but easy to write. It can be made a bit clearer by using parentheses around the case where x is not greater than 0:\n\nheaviside(x) = x > 0 ? 1.0 : (x == 0.0 ? 0.0 : -1.0)\n\nheaviside (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nSimilarly, new lines can clear up the flow:\n\nheaviside(x) = x > 0 ? 1.0 :\n               x == 0.0 ? 0.0 :\n               -1.0\n\nheaviside (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 Practice\n\nQuestion\nWhich of these definitions will be the equivalent of \\(f(x) = |x|\\)?

    "text": "2.8 Functions of multiple arguments\nThe concept of a function is of much more general use than its restriction to mathematical functions of single real variable. A natural application comes from describing basic properties of geometric objects. The following function definitions likely will cause no great concern when skimmed over:\n\nArea(w, h) = w * h                         # of a rectangle\nVolume(r, h) = pi * r^2 * h                    # of a cylinder\nSurfaceArea(r, h) = pi * r * (r + sqrt(h^2 + r^2)) # of a right circular cone\n\nSurfaceArea (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe right-hand sides may or may not be familiar, but it should be reasonable to believe that if push came to shove, they could be looked up. However, the left-hand sides are subtly different – they have two arguments, not one. In Julia it is trivial to define functions with multiple arguments – we just did.\nEarlier we saw the log function can use a second argument to express the base. This function is defined by log(b, x) = log(x) / log(b). The log(x) value is the natural log, and this definition just uses the change-of-base formula for logarithms.\nBut not so fast, on the left side is a function with two arguments and on the right side the functions have one argument – yet they share the same name. How does Julia know which to use? Julia uses the number, order, and type of the arguments passed to a function to determine which function definition to use. This is technically known as multiple dispatch or polymorphism. As a feature of the language, it can be used to greatly simplify the number of functions the user must learn. The basic idea is that many functions are “generic” in that they will work for many different scenarios. For example addition. It is defined for real numbers, integers, complex numbers, … . Each definition may be different, but to the end user only the operator + need be used. The rest happens behind the scenes. As an example, to see how many different definitions (“methods”) are defined in the base Julia language for the log operator, we can execute:\n\nmethods(log)\n\n# 40 methods for generic function log:

to be added as the language matures.\n\n2.8.1 An application of composition and multiple dispatch\nJulia’s multiple dispatch allows multiple functions with the same name. The function that gets selected depends on the arguments given to the function. We can exploit this to simplify our tasks. For example, consider this optimization problem:\n\nFor all rectangles of perimeter 20, what is the one with largest area?\n\nThe start of this problem is to represent the area in terms of one variable. We see next that composition can simplify this task, which when done by hand requires a certain amount of algebra.\nRepresenting the area of a rectangle in terms of two variables is easy:\n\nArea(w, h) = w * h\n\nArea (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBut the other fact about this problem – that the perimeter is 20 – means that height depends on width. For this question, we can see that \\(P=2w + 2h\\) so that\n\nh(w) = (20  - 2*w)/2\n\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nBy hand we would substitute this last expression into that for the area (to get \\(A=w\\cdot (20-2 \\cdot w)/2 = -w^2 + 10\\)) and simplify. However, within Julia we can let composition do the substitution and leave algebraic simplification for Julia to do:\n\nArea(w) = Area(w, h(w))\n\nArea (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThis might seem odd, as now we have two different but related functions named Area. Julia will decide which to use based on the number of arguments when the function is called. This allows both to be used on the same line, as above. This usage is not common with computer languages, but is a feature of Julia which is built around the concept of generic functions with multiple dispatch rules to decide which rule to call.\nFor example, the plot function expects functions of a single numeric variable. Behind the scenes, then the function A(w) will be used in this graph:\n\nplot(Area, 0, 10)\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we can see that that the width yielding the maximum area is \\(w=5\\), and so \\(h=5\\) as well."

    "text": "2.9 Functions with parameters\nParameters and function arguments are easily confused. We will use keywords for our parameters. Keywords also allow us to specify a default value. Using a keyword is as simple as specifying the desired argument with key=value.\nA simple case is a function which computes the \\(y\\) value on a line \\(y=mx+b\\) from a given \\(x\\) value. Here \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) are parameters. We will give them a default of \\(1\\) and \\(0\\):\n\nmxplusb(x; m=1, b=0) = m*x + b\n\nmxplusb (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe syntax is to use a semicolon to separate regular arguments from those with keywords. This is not needed when calling the function:\n\nmxplusb(2)              ## 1*2 + 0, using defaults\nmxplusb(2, m=2, b=3)                ## 2*2 + 3, using passed in values\n\n7\n\n\nFor a more complicated example, we revisit this function\n\\[\ng(x) = \\tan(\\theta) x + \\frac{32}{200 \\cos\\theta} x -\n     32 \\log\\left(\\frac{200 \\cos\\theta}{200\\cos\\theta - x}\\right).\n\\]\nRather than define the value of and \\(\\theta\\) outside the function, we can pass in the value for this parameter in this definition\n\nfunction g(x; theta=pi/4)\n     a = 200*cos(theta)\n     tan(theta)*x + (32/a)*x - 32*log(a/(a-x))\nend\n\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe default means g(50, theta=pi/4) would be the same as\n\ng(50)\n\n47.35323911536457\n\n\nThe parameter make it easy to look at other types of problems.

(Scoping rules determine where variables that are not passed in as arguments are found when referred to within a function.)\nA common pattern in the Julia ecosystem is to use two positional arguments to pass in the function value(s) and the parameter(s) (through f(x, p)). A container is typically used for each, but in this example we pass in x as a number, and use a named tuple container to pass the parameters. The unpacking of parameters can be done in different ways, here we just access the named fields using Julia’s access notation (e.g. p.b gets the value named b from the tuple):\n\nfunction mxplusb(x, p)\n   m, b = p.m, p.b\n   m * x + b\nend\np = (m=2, b=1)\nmxplusb(10, p)  # computes 2*10 + 1\n\n21\n\n\n\n2.9.1 Practice\n\nQuestion (transformations)\nWhich of these function definitions corresponds to shifting the function f to the right by c units and up by d units with a default of \\(0\\) and \\(0\\):\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=0, d=0) = c + d(f - x)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=0, d=0) = f(c * (x - d))\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=0, d=0) = d + f(x - c)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=0, d=0) = c + f(x - d)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion (transformations)\nWhich of these definitions will lengthen the period of a periodic function \\(f\\) by a factor of \\(c\\), with a default of \\(1\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=1) = c + f(x)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=1) = c * f(x)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=1) = f(c * x))\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        g(x; c=1) = f(x / c)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion (Wavelet transform)\nThe following transform of a function is at the core of wavelet theory:\n\ng(t; a=1, b=0) = (1/sqrt(a)) * f((t - b)/a)\n\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIf \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)/x\\) and \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=1\\) compute \\(g(0, a=2, b=1)\\).\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nLet \\(g\\) be defined by:\n\nfunction g(x; theta=pi/4)\n     a = 200*cos(theta)\n     tan(theta)*x + (32/a)*x + 32*log((a-x)/a)\nend\n\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nFor x in 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 degrees, what value will maximize g(125, theta=x*pi/180)?"

Calculus has two main operators: the derivative and the integral, as will be discussed elsewhere.\nIn Julia it is natural to use functions which mirror mathematical operators: functions which accept other functions as inputs and can output a function. In computer science terminology, Julia treats functions like first class objects.\nThe plot function has been previously used to illustrate some examples. The basic syntax for this call is plot(f, a, b). This fits into a more general template: verb(function_object, arguments....). Other upcoming examples are a “verb” for finding derivatives and a “verb” for finding integrals.\nLet’s look at a concrete example, where it is natural to both pass in a function and return a function.\nIn a precalculus course, we learn about transformations of functions where we relate the function \\(g(x) = d + af(c(x-b))\\) to the function \\(f(x)\\) in terms of the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\). Here we focus on \\(d\\) and \\(b\\) which shift up and right.\nLet’s make a function that takes \\(f\\), some specifications, and returns \\(g\\):\n\nfunction tform(f; shift_up=0, shift_right=0)\n  x -> shift_up + f(x - shift_right)\nend\n\ntform (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis basically is \\(g(x) = d + f(x-b)\\), but with longer names. This function takes as its main argument a function (f) and returns a function. (The “arrow” in the last line is defining an anonymous function for returning.)\nHere we look at \\(1/(x-2)\\) evaluated at \\(3\\):\n\nf(x) = 1/x\ntf(x) = tform(f, shift_right=2)(x) ## returns a function\ntf(3)\n\n1.0\n\n\nWe can use the output of tform directly in a function call, or make a specific version of the function, as above, by defining it for certain values of its parameters.\n\n\n2.10.2 Practice\n\nQuestion\nWhat anonymous function will create \\(\\sin(x^2)\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        x -> sin(x^2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        x -> sin^2(x)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        x -> sin(x)^2\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat anonymous function of \\(x\\) will return the polynomial \\(x^2 - 2x\\):\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        () -> x^2 - 2x\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        x ->x^2 - 2x\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        x^2 - 2x -> x\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat does this operator do?\n\nfunction secant(f, a, b)\n  m = (f(b) - f(a)) / (b-a)\n  x -> f(a) - m * (x - a)\nend\n\nsecant (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        It computes the slope of the secant line.\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        It produces an error.\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        It returns a function to compute the secant line between a and b.\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat does this function do?\n\nfunction mystery(f)\n   x -> -f(x)\nend\n\nmystery (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        It returns a function whose graph is that of f reflected through the \\(x\\) axis\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        It is a mystery\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        It returns a function whose graph is that of f reflected through the \\(y\\) axis"

    "section": "2.11 Additional details",
    "text": "2.11 Additional details\nThis section presents some additional details on writing functions in Julia that are here for informational purposes only.\n\n2.11.1 Return values, tuples\nAs mentioned, the value returned by a function is either the last value executed or any value returned by return. For a typical real valued function \\(f\\) this is usually just a number. Sometimes it is convenient to return more than one value. For this a tuple proves useful:\nA tuple is a container for holding different objects at once. They are made quite simply by enclosing the values in parentheses:\n\n(1, \"one\")\n\n(1, \"one\")\n\n\nTuples have many uses, but here we want to focus on their use as return values. Here is a somewhat contrived example. Imagine you write a function to compute the value of \\(f(x) = x^x\\), but you want to ensure \\(x\\) is positive, as otherwise there will be an error. You can do this, where we return a value of NaN and a message when the user tries to use a negative number:\n\nf(x) = x > 0 ?  (x^x, \"\") : (NaN, \"You can't use non-positive numbers\")\n\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nWe include a message even when the value of \\(x\\) is okay, as it is good practice –though not a requirement of Julia – to always return the same type of object, regardless the input.\nA simple call would be:\n\nf(-1)\n\n(NaN, \"You can't use non-positive numbers\")\n\n\nWe get a tuple back. Julia makes working with tuple return values very easy. We can destructure them by simply placing two variable names on the left-hand side:\n\na, msg = f(-1)          # alternatively: (a, b) = f(-1)\n\n(NaN, \"You can't use non-positive numbers\")\n\n\nA less artificial example will be discussed later: the quadgk function which estimates the value of an integral. For this computation both the value and an estimated maximum error are of interest, so both are returned as a tuple.\n\n\n2.11.2 Specializing functions by argument type\nTypical functions here are real-valued functions of a single variable. The easiest way to use these is to just mimic the regular mathematical notation as much as possible. However, there are times where we want to be specific about what possible values a user can place into a function. For example, a naive function to compute the binomial coefficients,\n\\[\n{ n \\choose k } = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)! k!},\n\\]\ncan be specialized to just integer values with:\n\nbinom(n::Integer, k::Integer) = factorial(n)/(factorial(n-k) * factorial(k))\n\nbinom (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe extra bit ::Integer specializes n and k so that this function only is called with both n and k are of this type.\nThen we can call our binom function as:\n\nbinom(10,4)\n\n210.0\n\n\nBut not as follows, as \\(\\pi\\) is not an integer:\n\nbinom(10, pi)\n\nLoadError: MethodError: no method matching binom(::Int64, ::Irrational{:π})\n\u001b[0mClosest candidates are:\n\u001b[0m  binom(::Integer, \u001b[91m::Integer\u001b[39m) at In[78]:1\n\n\n(The actual binomial function is much better than this, as it doesn’t divide a big number by a big number, which can cause real issues with loss of precision, though it does specialize to integers, and any sub-type. It also always returns an integer, whereas ours returns a floating-point value.)\nTypes in Julia are a more complicated matter than we want to get into here, but we do want to list the common types useful for basic calculus: Function, Real, Integer, Rational, Complex, and Number (real or complex).\nClearly the latter ones should nest, in that an object of type Integer should also be of type Real. This means when we specialize a mathematical function, it is enough to specify values of Real.\n\n\n2.11.3 Generic and anonymous functions\nIn Julia there are really two types of functions: generic functions and anonymous functions. A generic function is created when we use this form to create a function:\n\ng1(x) = sin(3x^2 - 2x^3)\n\ng1 (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nAn anonymous function is made when we do something like\n\ng2 = x -> sin(3x^2 - 2x^3)\n\n#30 (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nFor the most part the end user can’t tell the difference:\n\n(g1(1), g2(1))\n\n(0.8414709848078965, 0.8414709848078965)\n\n\nBut, there are times when there can be a conflict, in particular when you try to redefine a generic function as an anonymous function:\n\ng2 = x -> sin(2x^2)\n\n#32 (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nOr vice versa. Basically, Julia has assigned a certain function type to that name and you can’t change that type though you can change the function’s definition. (This is one exception to the “dynamic” aspect of Julia.)\nWe use the generic function approach in these notes to define our named functions, as the basic notation so closely mirrors the standard math notation."

At this point there are many different ones (Makie, PyPlot, plotly, plotlyjs, GR, Winston, Gadfly, Gaston,…), and perhaps more will be generated before a dominant one is arrived at. As such, we don’t try to teach the details of any one of them.\nCurrently, the the Plots package provides a unified interface to many backend plotting packages. We will use the Plots package in these examples.\nFor the impatient, this is all that is needed to know to get up and running.\nusing MTH229\nusing Plots\nThen, graphing a function is as easy as specifying the function and the domain to graph over, e.g.:\n\nf(x) = exp(-x^2/2)\nplot(f, -3, 3)          # plot f over [-3,3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplotly\n\n\n\nThe default graphics of Plots are static. Adding one additional call, plotly(). will use an interactive backend for Plots which will show the (x,y) position of points on the graph when a mouse hovers over them. (The default can be re-loaded by the command: gr().)\n\n\nGraphs can be layered by using the plot! function (with an exclamation point indicating a current graph is begin modified):\n\nf(x) = cos(x)\ng(x) = 1 - x^2/2\nplot(f, -pi/2, pi/2)\nplot!(g)        #  the domain to plot is optional if adding a layer\n\n\n\n\nFor the more patient, the rest of the sections cover some additional details including how to specify a graph by defining the points that are used to make the plot."

    "section": "3.2 The plot function",
    "text": "3.2 The plot function\nThe most basic usage for plotting a function follows this pattern:\nplot(function_object, from, to)     # or plot(f, a, b)\nas in\n\nplot(sin, 0, 2pi)\n\n\n\n\nThat creates the graphic. The Plots package is an interface to several plotting “backends.” Within IJulia and using plotly() the graph will be automatically displayed as an SVG graphic that allows you to zoom and pan with the mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\nThis is another example of a general template action(function_object, args…) for performing some action on a function. In this case, the action is to plot a function and the additional args… indicate the domain to plot over.)\n\n\nAgain, we plot a function, this time a basic polynomial:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\nplot(f, -3, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Adding layers using “plot!”\nA graph can have layers added to it using plot! or other such functions. For example, adding the function zero will emphasize the x axis:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\nplot(f, -3, 3)\nplot!(zero)     # x axis\n\n\n\n\nThe automatic legend can be supressed by passing the argument legend=false to the initial plot command.\nAdding points can be done with the scatter! command. We put the x and y values into containers defined by []. For example, the polynomial \\(x^2 - 3x +2\\) has roots at \\(2\\) and \\(1\\), we emphasize this through:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2\nrts = [1, 2]\nplot(f, 0, 3)\nscatter!(rts, [0, 0])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Inf, NaN values\nPlots plots functions by creating a large number of paired points \\((x, f(x))\\); it then plots these points; and, finally, connects the points with line segments. In the numerous function evaluations, it is of course quite possible that some of the points will return Inf or NaN. (Where Inf is a floating point value for infinity and results from evaluations like 1/0 and NaN stands for “not a number”, and results from indeterminate evaluations such as 0/0.)\nThe values which are Inf can not reasonably be plotted. Values which are NaN can not reasonably plotted. What to do? Such points are simply not plotted, and no line segments are drawn causing the plot to be discontinuous. This convention can be utilized to good effect.\nFor example, to create bounded graphs, we can trim out any large values and replace them with NaN. A function that can be used to modify an arbitrary function (like \\(f(x) = 1/x\\)) and return a function that can be plotted can be defined as follows:\n\ntrim(f; val=10) = x -> abs(f(x)) > val ? NaN : f(x)\n\ntrim (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis action is very similar to clamping.\nThe MTH229 package implements this in the function rangeclamp(f, hi=20, lo=-hi). (Base julia has a clamp function.)\nUsing rangeclamp is fairly simple. The output is a function, so can be passed directly to the plot call:\n\nf(x) = 1/x\nplot(rangeclamp(f), -3, 3)\n\n\n\n\nOr\n\nplot(rangeclamp(f, 100), -3, 3)\n\n\n\n\nThis trimming also works when Inf and -Inf values are encountered, as both can be ordered by >.\n\n\n3.2.3 Plotting with anonymous functions\nConsider a function with a parameter, theta, defined by:\n\nfunction g(x; theta=pi/4)\n     a = 200*cos(theta)\n     tan(theta)*x + (32/a)*x - 32*log(a/(a-x))\nend\n\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nPlotting g will use the default value of \\(\\pi/4\\). To plot with a different value, say \\(\\pi/3\\) we can create a new function:\n\nf(x) = g(x, theta=pi/3)\nplot(f, 0, 100)\n\n\n\n\nWhich works, but is a bit verbose.

    "section": "3.3 Asymptotes",
    "text": "3.3 Asymptotes\nA rational function is nothing more than a ratio of polynomial functions, say \\(f(x) = p(x)/q(x)\\). One interesting thing about such function is there can be asymptotes. These can be vertical (which can happen when \\(q(x)=0\\)), horizontal (as \\(x\\) gets large or small), or even slanted.\nThe vertical asymptotes require care when plotting, as the naive style of plotting where a collection of points is connected by straight lines can render poor graphs when the scale of \\(y\\) values get too large. The really large values plotted near the asymptote can wipe out the possibility of seeing other features of interest in a graph.\nSome features of interest for a graph that are identifiable by calculus concepts are:\n\nzeroes\nvertical asymptotes\nhorizontal asymptotes (or even slant ones)\nrelative maximum and minimum\nincreasing and decreasing parts\nchanges in inflection\n\nFor example, if you want to find zeroes of a function, you really want to look at areas of the graph where the \\(y\\) values are close to \\(0\\). However, if you have a vertical asymptote on the same graph, the \\(y\\) values might also be asked to show very large or small values. With only a finite number of pixels available, it is impossible to easily do both.\nWhat to do? If you were on a smartphone, you might be tempted to pan around to avoid the asymptotes, then pinch and zoom narrow the graph to the feature of interest. With julia you basically do the same thing, though panning and zooming is done by changing the domain of the \\(x\\) values used in plotting.\nLet’s look at the function \\(f(x) = 1/x\\), which has an obvious vertical asymptote at \\(0\\).\nOne can try a simple plot:\n\nplot(x -> 1/x, -3, 3)\n\n\n\n\nThe issue at \\(0\\) is avoided, as the points chosen by Plots do not include \\(0\\). The asymptote appears as a strongly slanted line, as individual points are simply connected in a dot-to-dot manner.\nDoing better without much work is done by simply restricting the part that is plotted. (Alternatively, you can use NaN values or multiple functions on one.) For this example, we can easily draw the positive part:\n\nplot(x -> 1/x, 0, 3)\n\n\n\n\nIt is best to avoid the asymptote at \\(0\\) completely by backing away by enough to avoid the large range on the \\(y\\) axis. In this case, starting around \\(1/10\\) is reasonable:\n\nplot(x -> 1/x, 1/10,  3)\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the rational function\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x-1}\n\\]\nThis will have a vertical asymptote at \\(1\\), zeros at \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) and a slant asymptote. A quick graph from \\(-10\\) to \\(10\\) shows just some of this:\n\nf(x) = (x-2)*(x-3)/(x-1)\nplot(f, -10, 10)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the slant asymptote and the vertical asymptote, but have no chance of seeing the zeros or the local extrema. For that, we can restrict the domain to plot over.\nFor example, to graph to the right of the asymptote can be done with:\n\nplot(f, 1 + 0.5, 4)\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the two zeros and gives an idea of the relative minimum. Similarly, a plot of the left of the asymptote can be illustrative. Here we step back by a bit:\n\nplot(f, -3, 1 - 0.1)\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that the relative maximum occurs between \\(-1\\) and \\(0\\).\nHere we see what happens to the asymptote. The scale of the \\(y\\) values is huge. We added a small amount to the left endpoint in case the function is not defined there, but this function takes the reciprocal of a small amount and makes it huge. Clearly we need to really avoid the issue. It isn’t hard – just add a little bit more to \\(0\\).\nOne solution to avoiding this issue is to use the rangeclamp function that was previously described. This just caps off really large values so that the vertical asymptotes don’t affect the scale of the graph. We can see the asymptotes pretty clearly with:\n\nplot(rangeclamp(f), -10, 10)\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Trigonometric functions\nLet\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{5}{\\cos x} + \\frac{10}{\\sin x}.\n\\]\nEstimate graphically the minimum value over \\((0, \\pi/2)\\).\nThe domain comes from the fact that \\(\\sin(0) = 0\\) and \\(\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0\\), so we will have asymptotes at each. A simple graph shows there are issues:\n\nf(x) = 5/cos(x) + 10/sin(x)\nplot(f, 0, pi/2)\n\n\n\n\nAs typical with vertical asymptotes, we can’t see finer features of the graph when the asymptotes are drawn. To remedy, we again back off from the boundaries. Since \\(\\sin(x)\\) behaves like \\(x\\) near \\(0\\), we pick delta = 0.3 again and expect a max near \\(10/(3/10) \\approx 33\\).\n\ndelta = 0.3;\nplot(f, 0 + delta, pi/2 - delta)\n\n\n\n\nWith this, we see the minimum value is near \\(y=20\\) and occurs around \\(0.9\\).\n\n\n3.3.1 Practice\n\nQuestion\nThe function \\(f(x) = (x^3 - 2x) / (2x^2 -10)\\) is a rational function with issues when \\(2x^2 = 10\\), or \\(x = -\\sqrt{5}\\) or \\(\\sqrt{5}\\).\nPlot this function from \\(-5\\) to \\(5\\).

    "section": "3.4 Arrays",
    "text": "3.4 Arrays\nWhen we learn how to make a graph using paper and pencil, the “T” method is employed, so called as we draw a “T” and fill in values to plot for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\nFor example, a chalkboard after the instructor shows how to plot \\(f(x) = x^2\\) might have this drawn on it:\nx |  y\n------\n1 |  1\n2 |  4\n3 |  9\n4 | 16\nAs these are the steps done to create the ordered pairs for a plot, we would like to be able to mimic the following procedures used above in julia:\n\nchoose a collection of \\(x\\) values\ncreate the corresponding \\(y\\) values\nplot the pairs \\((x,y)\\) and connect with lines\n\nWe have seen how variables can be used to refer to a single value, but we want to refer to more than one value now. A container for holding such is an Array. Arrays are implemented in most all computer languages, though the term can mean different things. We are looking for vectors, or one-dimensional arrays. In general, an array is a multidimensional grid of values – all of the same type (integer, floating point, functions, …, or ANY).\nFor our purposes, we want vectors (one dimensional, \\(n\\) by 1 arrays in julia). These can be easily constructed in different ways.\n\n3.4.1 Creating 1-dimensional arrays with []\nIn many different contexts, julia uses [] to create collections from individual components.\nFor example, to directly create a 1-dimensional array with the [] syntax one simply types in the values separated by commas:\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n\n\nOr\n\n[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]\n\n6-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 5\n 8\n\n\nThese create “vectors.” Row vectors (which are arrays, but not of type Vector) are created when no commas are specified:\n\n[13 21 34 55]\n\n1×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n 13  21  34  55\n\n\nThe notation is that [a, b, c] combines a, b, and c vertically and [a b c] combines them horizontally. The former is good to make column vectors for single values (scalars).\nRow and column vectors are different! We will primarily use column vectors going forward.\nContainers are for like values…\nIn general, julia uses [ and ] to create containers for like values. These containers can be more complicated than a single row or column. One subtle thing is that each object must be of the same value, though sometimes this happens by a silent conversion. So, mixing integer and floating point numbers will produce a container of just floating point values:\n\n[1, 2.0]\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n 1.0\n 2.0\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Creating arithmetic sequences\nA basic set of numbers used in programming are the values 1,2, …, n. These are the simplest example of an arithmetic progression or sequence, which in general can start in a different place and have steps of a size different from \\(1\\):\n\\[\na, a + h, a+2h, a+3h, ..., a + nh\n\\]\nIt should be possible to specify arithmetic sequences either by\n\nthe start and end points and the number of points employed\nthe start and end points and step size.\n\nIn julia the range function will do the former and the range operator the latter.\nHere are 5 evenly spaced numbers from \\(0\\) to \\(\\pi/2\\) given by range\n\nrange(0, pi/2, length=5)\n\n0.0:0.39269908169872414:1.5707963267948966\n\n\nThe values are not displayed, but will be if collected:\n\ncollect(range(0, pi/2, length=5))\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.0\n 0.39269908169872414\n 0.7853981633974483\n 1.1780972450961724\n 1.5707963267948966\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 The range operator\nThe “range” operator, :, is used to specify a step size, like \\(h\\) in the definition above. To get values which step by 1 we simply specify the start and end values:\n\n1:4\n\n1:4\n\n\nThat isn’t so impressive. The description julia uses to show this value is exactly how we defined it, but this range is specifying the values 1, 2, 3, 4. To see that, we collect the values to make an array:\n\ncollect(1:4)\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n\n\nThe range operator returns a Range object which is much more compact to store than the array. (The range object is an iterator, something to be stepped through one at a time. Iterating over the elements specified by a range does not require all the elements at once, so they are not generated.)\nThe range operator can also work with a step size:\n\na=0; b=10; h=3\na:h:b\ncollect(a:h:b)\n\n4-element Vector{Int64}:\n 0\n 3\n 6\n 9\n\n\nNotice, the value for b is treated as as suggestion, the range will stop without exceeding b.\nThe \\(x\\) values for a plot are typically a sequence of increasing values from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). We would generally like to be able to specify the number of values to plot. This makes range the go-to choice to use.\n\n\n3.4.4 Practice\n\nQuestion\nWhich command will produce the sequence \\(1,3,5,7,9,11, ..., 99\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1:2:99\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        [1,3,5,7,9,11, ..., 99]\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1:99\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        range(1, 99, length=2)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich command produces 10 numbers between 0 and 10 that are evenly spaced?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        0:1:101\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        0:10\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        range(0, 10, length=10)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich command does not produce the numbers \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        range(1, 5, length=5)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1:5:1\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1:5\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhich command does produces the numbers \\(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        1:2:13\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        range(1, 13, length=7)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        [1,1,2,3,5,8,13]"

    "text": "3.6 Mapping a function to multiple values\nTo specify the \\(y\\) values we wish to “map” the function f to each \\(x\\) value. In julia there are many different ways to do this, we list four for completeness, but will restrict our attention to just the first three styles.\n\n3.6.1 The map function\nThe map function. In many areas of mathematics, one refers to a function as a “map” from the domain to the range. The implication is that the function takes all the \\(x\\) values to the corresponding \\(y\\) values at once (conceptually) and not one at a time. The map function will apply the function f to each value in the array x, basically taking [x1, x2, ..., xn] and returning [f(x1), f(x2), ..., f(xn)].\nFor example, let’s look at the simple polynomial \\(f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x\\). We define our julia function with:\n\nf(x) = -16x^2 + 32x\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIf we want to look at this function for \\(x\\) values between \\(0\\) and \\(2\\) we might define the \\(x\\) values with:\n\nx = range(0, 2, length=5)\n\n0.0:0.5:2.0\n\n\nThen the map function will create the corresponding \\(y\\) values:\n\nmap(f, x)\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.0\n 12.0\n 16.0\n 12.0\n  0.0\n\n\nThe syntax of map requires a slight pause. Here we do not actually call the function f, as in f(2). Rather, we pass the name of the function object to the map argument – and map calls the function for each value in the column vector x and returns a corresponding column vector.\nIt is also quite common to use anonymous functions with map. For example:\n\nmap(u -> 10 * u^2, x)\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.0\n  2.5\n 10.0\n 22.5\n 40.0\n\n\nWe use u for the dummy variable in the anonymous function, so as not to get it confused with the variable x holding our values, but this is not necessary.\n\n\n3.6.2 Broadcasting\nJulia allows a function to be broadcast over a collection of values with a simple notational trick or inserting a “.” before the parenthesis. To see, we have:\n\nsin.([1,2,3])\n\n3-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.8414709848078965\n 0.9092974268256817\n 0.1411200080598672\n\n\nIn this use, the output is the same as though map(sin, [1,2,3]) were called. In general, this “.” notation is a bit different, as there can be multiple arguments passed and the size of the values is matched if possible by replication. For example, this command find the logarithm of 5 for different bases. The value 5 is replicated once for each of the bases:\n\nlog.([2,pi,5,10], 5)\n\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n 2.321928094887362\n 1.4059543061897808\n 1.0\n 0.6989700043360187\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe “dot” broadcasting is very succinct and useful, but using map is more explicit and easier to reason about. We will mostly use broadcasting due to the simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Comprehensions\nMathematicians are fond of set notation, as in this way to describe the \\(y\\) values in a graph:\n\\[\ny = \\{ f(x): x \\text{ in } [0, 2] \\},\n\\]\nThis is read: “the values \\(f(x)\\) for each \\(x\\) in the interval \\([0,2]\\).”\nHere we define values xs to represent the continuum of values in the interval \\([0,2]\\), then use a “comprehension” to create the set notation above. The syntax is similar:\n\nxs = range(0, 2.0, length=5)\n[f(x) for x in xs]\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n  0.0\n 12.0\n 16.0\n 12.0\n  0.0\n\n\nThe two approaches, broadcasting/maps and comprehensions, are equally useful. Perhaps map is a bit less trouble, but comprehensions mirror a more familiar mathematical syntax and generalize to functions of more than one variable nicely. One difference to keep in mind when deciding which to use, is that broadcasting/mapping requires a function, whereas comprehensions use expressions.\n\n\n3.6.4 For loops\nFinally, for completeness, we mention another means to generate vectors of numbers that is more familiar to users of other computer languages.\nThe for loop is a very common pattern in computer programming. For speed reasons, some languages (e.g., MATLAB and R) try to avoid for loops for a “vectorized” approach (see below), but julia works well with for loops, and they are sometimes easier to understand than a vectorized approach.\nA for loop simply loops over each value in the iterable data vector x giving it a temporary name as it goes. To use a for loop to create the \\(y\\) values requires several steps. The first creates a container to hold the new values, using the similar function to make a vector of the same size as x below (but fills it with nonsense):\ny = similar(x);\nfor i in 1:length(x)\n   y[i] = f( x[i] )\nend\nThe for loop ends with the keyword end. Here we loop over each index of x and assign to the corresponding y value f(x[i]).\nConceptually this is the opposite of map where we think of the function acting on the entire column vector x. Instead, we iterate one-by-one over the values of x saving the function values as we go. The use of for loops is called imperative programming, as you describe each step. The use of functions like map is called declarative programming as you simply declare what you want and the computer language does the rest.\nIn some languages for loops are avoided if possible, as they can be slower. As well, they can require extra bookkeeping, such as needing to allocate a container for the answers. That being said, in julia they are widely used for speed and storage reasons. As well, they are used when we need to refer to more than one index. An example of that is the following way to create a Fibonacci pattern from the formula \\(x_i = x_{i-1} + x_{i-2}\\):\nx = zeros(Int, 10);         ## pre-allocate an integer array\nx[1:2] = [1,1]\nfor i in 3:length(x)\n   x[i] =  x[i-1] + x[i-2]\nend\nRelated to a for loop is the while loop. This will repeat as long as some condition is true. The following pattern reproduces a for loop:\ni, n = 1, length(x)\nwhile (i <= n)\n  print( x[i], \" \" )            ## do something ...\n  i = i + 1\nend\nWe will use while loops when we iterate some process and are waiting until some computed value gets close to \\(0\\).\n\n\n3.6.5 Example\nPutting this altogether, to create the “T”-table used to graph \\(y=x^2\\), we could do any of these:\n\nf(x) = x^2\nxs = 1:4\nys = map(f, xs)\n[xs ys]\n\n4×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1   1\n 2   4\n 3   9\n 4  16\n\n\nor\n\nf(x) = x^2\nxs = 1:4\nys = f.(xs)\n[xs ys]\n\n4×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1   1\n 2   4\n 3   9\n 4  16\n\n\nor\n\nxs = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nys = [x^2 for x in xs]\n[xs ys]\n\n4×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1   1\n 2   4\n 3   9\n 4  16\n\n\nor\n\nxs = 1:4\nys = similar(xs)\nfor i in 1:length(xs)\n    ys[i] = xs[i]^2\nend\n[xs ys]\n\n4×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1   1\n 2   4\n 3   9\n 4  16\n\n\nMany options, but the shortest to type is simply [xs f.(xs)], so that is what is used most commonly.\n\n\n3.6.6 Practice\n\nQuestions\nDoes this command produce the values \\(\\{.1, .01, .001, .0001\\}\\)?\nx = [(1/10)^i for i in 1:4]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        true\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        false\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\nLet \\(f(x) = x^2 - 2x\\).

For example, this is used to add a secant line to a graph. The following function (which is in the MTH229 package) will create a function which represents the secant line of \\(f(x)\\) between two points, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\nfunction secant(f, a, b)\n     m =  (f(b) - f(a)) / (b-a) # slope of secant line\n     x -> f(a) + m * (x - a)\nend\nPause for a moment to see what this function does. The first line simply finds the slope between the two points \\((a,f(a))\\) and \\((b,f(b))\\). The second does something with the point-slope form of a line using the point \\((a, f(a))\\). The tricky part is that last line defines an anonymous function to be returned (the x -> part). So secant is an operator – a function which accepts a function for an argument and returns a function.\nUsing this function makes it simple to add a secant line to a graph.\n\nf(x) = sin(x)\na, b = 0, pi/2\nplot(f, a, b)\nplot!(secant(f, a, b))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.1 Practice\n\nQuestion\nDefine \\(f(x)\\) to be a triangular function as follows:\n\nf(x) = max(0, 1.0 - abs(x))\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIn many applications, the following transformation is employed:\n\\[\ng(x, c, h) = \\frac{1}{h} f(\\frac{x - c}{h})\n\\]\nFor constants \\(h\\) and \\(c\\).\nMake a graph of both \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x, 1, 1/2)\\) over the interval \\([-2,3]\\).

Here we mention graphing, such as is done with a graphing calculator. In the next section, we discuss the bisection algorithm for root finding.\n\nFinding a zero\nThe flight of an arrow can be modeled using various functions, depending on assumptions. Suppose an arrow is launched in the air from a height of 0 feet above the ground at an angle of \\(\\theta = \\pi/4\\). With a suitable choice for the initial velocity, a model without wind resistance for the height of the arrow at a distance \\(x\\) units away may be:\n\\[\nj(x) = \\tan(\\theta) x - (1/2) \\cdot g(\\frac{x}{v_0 \\cos\\theta})^2.\n\\]\nIn Julia we have, taking \\(v_0=200\\):\n\nj(x; theta=pi/4, g=32, v0=200) = tan(theta)*x - (1/2)*g*(x/(v0*cos(theta)))^2\n\nj (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWith a velocity-dependent wind resistance given by \\(\\gamma\\), again with some units, a similar equation can be constructed. It takes a different form:\n\\[\ny(x) = (\\frac{g}{\\gamma v_0 \\cos(\\theta)} + \\tan(\\theta)) \\cdot x  +\n      \\frac{g}{\\gamma^2}\\log(\\frac{v_0\\cos(\\theta) - \\gamma x}{v_0\\cos(\\theta)})\n\\]\nAgain, \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity and is taken to be \\(200\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) a resistance, which we take to be \\(1\\). With this, we have the following Julia definition (with a slight reworking of \\(\\gamma\\)):\n\nfunction y(x; theta=pi/4, g=32, v0=200, gamma=1)\n     a = gamma * v0 * cos(theta)\n     (g/a + tan(theta)) * x + g/gamma^2 * log((a-gamma^2 * x)/a)\nend\n\ny (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nFor each model, we wish to find the value of \\(x\\) after launching where the height is modeled to be 0.

Let’s guess the distance is no more than 500 feet:\n\nplot(j, 0, 500)\n\n\n\n\nWell, we haven’t even seen the peak yet. Plotting over a wider interval will show that \\(1250\\) is the largest root. So we plot over this domain to visualize the flight:\n\nplot(j, 0, 1250)\n\n\n\n\nAs for the model with wind resistance, a quick plot over the same interval, \\([0, 1250]\\) yields:\n\nplot(y, 0, 1250)\n\n\n\n\nOh, “Domain Error.” Of course, when the argument to the logarithm is negative we will have issues.\nWe solve for when \\(a-\\gamma^2 x\\) is \\(0\\):\n\ngamma = 1\na = 200 * cos(pi/4)\nb = a/gamma^2\n\n141.4213562373095\n\n\nWe try on the reduced interval avoiding the obvious asymptote at b by subtracting \\(1\\):\n\nplot(y, 0, b - 1)\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see the zero is around 140.

    "section": "4.4 Bisection algorithm",
    "text": "4.4 Bisection algorithm\nThe last example had us graphically “zoom” in on a zero, and led us to an estimate to \\(1\\) or \\(2\\) decimal points. Trying to get more accuracy than that graphically is at best tedious. Here we discuss a method to get as much accuracy as is numerically possible based on the intermediate value theorem:\nThe intermediate value theorem: If \\(f(x)\\) is a continuous function on \\([a,b]\\) then at some point in the interval \\(f(x)\\) takes on any value between \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\).\nIn particular if \\(f(x)\\) is continuous with \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\) having different signs then there must be a point \\(c\\) in \\([a,b]\\) where \\(f(c) = 0\\). (When \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f(b)\\) have different signs, we say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) bracket a root.) This observation is due to Bolzano.\nThe bisection algorithm utilizes Bolzano’s observation. It is a simple iterative procedure for finding such a value \\(c\\) when we have a continuous function and a bracketing interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert\n\n\n\nThe bisection method does not work when the function does not cross the \\(x\\) axis at the root. For example, the zero at \\(0\\) of \\(f(x) = x^2 e^x\\) would not be found with this method.\n\n\nMathematically the basic idea is simple.\nStarting with \\([a,b]\\), the midpoint \\(M = (a + b)/2\\), is tested for its function value. If \\(f(M) = 0\\), great, we are done. If it has opposite sign of \\(f(a)\\), then a root must be in the interval \\([a,M]\\), so the problem is reduced a smaller interval. Otherwise, it has opposite sign of \\(f(b)\\) and the problem is reduced to \\([M,b]\\). Either way, the algorithm is repeated for the smaller interval where a root is known. As each step halves the interval length, it must eventually converge to an answer.\nGraphically, we could do this. For example, Let’s consider \\(f(x) = x^2 - 2\\) with the bracketing interval \\([1,2]\\). We first plot:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2\na,b = 1, 2\nplot(f, a, b)\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that \\(c = (a + b)/2 = 3/2\\) will have \\(f(c) > 0\\), so the new bracket is \\([a,c]\\):\n\na, b = a, (a + b)/2\nplot(f, a, b)\n\n\n\n\nNow the midpoint is negative, so we modify a:\n\na, b = (a + b)/2, b\nplot(f, a, b)\n\n\n\n\nAnd again, this has a midpoint in the negative territory so again we modify a:\n\na, b = (a + b)/2, b\nplot(f, a, b)\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, as the midpoint is in positive territory we would modify \\(b\\) …\nThis gets tedious to do graphically. But it can be easily programmed. The main step might look something like this:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2\na, b = 1, 2\n\nc = (a + b) /2\n\nif f(a) * f(c) < 0\n  a, b = a, c\nelse\n  a, b = c, b\nend\na,b\n\n(1, 1.5)\n\n\nThough some check if f(c) == 0 is also needed.\nHere \\(c=1.5\\) and the new interval is \\([1.0, 1.5]\\), as we had graphically. We just need to repeat the above.\nIt seems as though we could be here all day. Indeed, if doing this by hand it might take up quite a bit of time. We should automate this. Before automating this, we need to think: when would we stop?\nMathematically we can keep taking halves using the concept of a limit. See for example Zeno’s paradox. On a computer we don’t have such a luxury. In fact, for floating point numbers we couldn’t keep taking halves – even if we wanted – as ultimately we should expect tp get a and b being floating point values that are next to each other – and hence there is no midpoint. (Well, there are some cases that suggest a more careful numeric approach to the above.)\nSo even though this doesn’t make mathematical sense we can try stopping when the following condition is no longer true:\n\na < c < b\n\nfalse\n\n\nA while loop is used to repeat the central step until the above (or some variant) is false.\nThe MTH229 package has a bisection method implemented for this which also outputs a graphical indication of the first few steps taken.\nOkay, let’s look at the function \\(f(x) = -16x^2 + 32x\\). We know that 0 and \\(2\\) are roots. Let’s see if our algorithm finds them:\n\nf(x) = -16x^2 + 32x\nbisection(f, -1, 1) ## should find 0\n\n\na###############################################################b\n... exact answer found ...\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n\nbisection(f, 1, 3)  ## should find 2\n\n\na###############################################################b\n... exact answer found ...\n\n\n2.0\n\n\nOkay, it seems to work. Lets try it on a less trivial problem. We know \\(\\sin(x)\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\) cross in the interval \\([0, \\pi/2]\\). If we are too tired to remember where, we can simply ask:\n\nf(x) = cos(x) - sin(x)\nx = bisection(f, 0, pi/2)\n\n\na###############################################################b\n................................a###############################b\n................................a###############b................\n................................a#######b........................\n................................a###b............................\n................................a#b..............................\n................................ab...............................\n                                ⋮⋮                               \n\n\n\n0.7853981633974483\n\n\nIs x really a zero?\n\nx, f(x)\n\n(0.7853981633974483, 1.1102230246251565e-16)\n\n\nHmm, the answer is 1.1102230246251565e-16. So technically this is not a zero. But computationally it is a zero! First it should be clear that it is really close to zero. We will see it is as close as computationally possible to a zero.\nThe nextfloat and prevfloat functions find the floating point values just bigger than x and just smaller. In this case we have that f(x) and f(nextfloat(x)) have different signs:\n\nf(x),  f(nextfloat(x))\n\n(1.1102230246251565e-16, -1.1102230246251565e-16)\n\n\nSo \\(f\\) is crossing \\(0\\) between the value we found, x and, the floating point value just a bit bigger. We can’t realistically expect to get any closer than that, as there are no machine numbers in between these two.\n\n4.4.1 The Roots package and find_zero\nThe bisection method, while easy to describe and understand, can be made a bit more efficient. The find_zero function from the Roots package does so. This package is loaded when MTH229 is. This function uses a tuple to specify the bracketing interval. but does not need to typed in.\nFor example, to find a root of \\(f(x) = 2x \\cdot \\exp(-20) - 2 \\cdot \\exp(-20x) + 1\\) in the interval \\([0,1]\\) we have:\n\nusing Roots\nf(x) = 2x * exp(-20) - 2 * exp(-20x) + 1\nfind_zero(f, (0, 1))\n\n0.03465735902085385\n\n\nThe find_zero function is actually an interface to various root-finding algorithms. When called as above – with two intial starting points – it uses a bracketing approach as discussed here, though with a different notion of the midpoint.\nA slightly different interface is given by the fzero function, where that above would be:\n\nfzero(f, 0, 1)\n\n0.03465735902085385\n\n\n\nExample: Graphical and numerical answers\nOne needs to know where to look in order to use the bisection method. The basic “one-two punch” is:\n\ngraph the function to identify quickly values \\([a,b]\\) which bound a zero, then\nuse the bisection method to find the zero to many decimal points.\n\nHere we illustrate with the problem of finding all intersection points of \\(e^x = x^4\\) over the interval \\([0,10]\\).\nRecall, solving for \\(g(x) = h(x)\\) is identical to the problem of solving \\(f(x) = 0\\), where we define \\(f(x) = g(x) - h(x)\\). So our problem is to find solutions to \\(e^x - x^4 = 0\\).\nA quick plot shows that the function has such a wide range that looking over the entire domain at once will be problematic:\n\nf(x) = exp(x) - x^4\nplot(f, 0, 10)\n\n\n\n\nInstead, we look between \\([0,3]\\) and \\([8,9]\\). A quick confirmation shows these are good choices to use. For example, between \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) we have:\n\nplot(f, 8, 9)\n\n\n\n\nSo we find the values of the zero in the bracketed region \\([8,9]\\):\n\nfind_zero(f, (8, 9))\n\n8.6131694564414\n\n\nThe root within \\([0, 3]\\) is found with:\n\nfind_zero(f, (0, 3))\n\n1.4296118247255556\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Problems\n\nQuestion\nIn the bisection method algorithm we checked that the value of \\(f\\) at \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) had opposite signs by looking at \\(f(a)\\cdot f(b)\\). Why did this work?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        The product of 2 numbers with opposite signs is negative, the product of 2 numbers with the same signs is positive\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        The product of two numbers is never negative\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        The product of two numbers will have the sign of the first one.\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Are there other roots in [-10, 0]?\nThere is another root in the interval \\([-10, 0]\\) for the function \\(f(x) = e^x - x^4\\).

This function has two zeros on the positive \\(x\\) axis.

In a previous problem we graphically found the largest root. Now find the second largest root using the graph to bracket the answer, and then solving.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What goes up must come down…\n\n\n\nUp and down\n\n\nIn 1638, according to Amir D. Aczel, an experiment was performed in the French Countryside. A monk, Marin Mersenne, launched a cannonball straight up into the air in an attempt to help Descartes prove facts about the rotation of the earth. Though the experiment was not successful, Mersenne later observed that the time for the cannonball to go up was greater than the time to come down. According to “Vertical Projection in a Resisting Medium: Reflections on Observations of Mersenne”.\nThis isn’t the case for simple ballistic motion where the time to go up is equal to the time to come down. We can “prove” this numerically. For simple ballistic motion, \\(f(t) = -(1/2)\\cdot 32 t^2 + v_0t\\). The time to go up and down are found by the two zeros of this function. The peak time is related to a zero of a function given by D(f), which for now we’ll take as a mystery function, but later will be known as the derivative.\nLet \\(v_0= 390\\). The three times in question can be found from the zeros of f and f'. What are they?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \\((-4.9731, 0.0, 4.9731)\\)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \\((0.0, 12.1875, 24.375)\\)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \\((0.0, 625.0, 1250.0)\\)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What goes up must come down… (again)<\nFor simple ballistic motion you find that the time to go up is the time to come down. For motion within a resistant medium, such as air, this isn’t the case. Suppose a model for the height as a function of time is given by\n\\[\nh(t) = (\\frac{g}{\\gamma^2} + \\frac{v_0}{\\gamma})(1 - e^{-\\gamma t}) - \\frac{gt}{\\gamma}\n\\]\n(From “On the trajectories of projectiles depicted in early ballistic Woodcuts”)\nHere \\(g=32\\), again we take \\(v_0=390\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) is a drag coefficient that we will take to be \\(1\\). This is valid when \\(h(t) \\geq 0\\). In Julia, rather than hard-code the parameter values, for added flexibility we can pass them in as keyword arguments:\n\nh(t; g=32, v0=390, gamma=1) = (g/gamma^2 + v0/gamma)*(1 - exp(-gamma*t)) - g*t/gamma\n\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nNow find the three times: \\(t_0\\), the starting time; \\(t_a\\), the time at the apex of the flight; and \\(t_f\\), the time the object returns to the ground.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \\((0, 32.0, 390.0)\\)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \\((0, 2.579, 13.187)\\)\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        \\((0, 13.187, 30.0)\\)"

One counts the number of sign changes amongst the polynomials coefficients. Suppose this is \\(k\\), then the number of positive real roots (counting multiplicities) is one of \\(k\\), \\(k-2\\), \\(k-4\\), … . In particular if \\(k\\) is odd, there must be at least one real root.\nFor example, the polynomial \\(x^3 -x^2 -x - 1\\) has signs + - - -, so there is just one sign change. This implies there must be exactly one positive real root, which is identifyied with:\n\nf(x) = x^3 -x^2 -x - 1\nN.(sympy.real_roots(f(x)))\n\n1-element Vector{BigFloat}:\n 1.839286755214161132551852564653286600424178746097592246778758639404203222081975\n\n\nFor the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^5 -x + 1\\) has potentially 2 positive, real roots?

Instead of looking at the sign changes of \\(f(x)\\), one must look at the sign changes of \\(g(x) = f(-x)\\).\nIf \\(f(x) = x^5 - x +1\\) we have \\(g(x) = -x^5 +x + 1\\) (just change the signs of the coefficients of the odd powers). Then \\(g(x)\\) has one sign change. This means there is one negative real root. What is it?"

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nThe concept of a limit is what makes calculus possible. Limits are used to define the two main concepts of calculus: derivatives and integrals. The formal definition of a limit is a bit difficult to appreciate and grasp. It involves an “\\(\\epsilon-\\delta\\)” formulation:\n\nThe limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\) is \\(L\\) if for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) there exists a \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that whenever \\(0 < |x - c| < \\delta\\) then \\(|f(x) - L| < \\epsilon\\).\n\nWhen a limit exists, we write:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) = L.\n\\]\nHowever the intuition of limits is more accessible. This intuition was known as early as the Greeks: Archimedes figured out the area under a parabola over 2000 years ago by the method of exhaustion, a limiting process. Fermat in 1629 essentially took a limit to find the slope of a tangent line to a polynomial curve. Newton in the late 1600s, exploited the idea in his development of calculus (as did Leibnez). Yet it wasn’t until the 1800s that Bolzano, Cauchy, and Weierstrass put the idea on a firm footing, as above.\nTo get the intuition behind a limit we replace the absolute value inequalities in the definition with “close” and read as follows: as \\(x\\) gets “close” to \\(c\\) (but not equal), then \\(f(x)\\) should get “close” to \\(L\\)."

    "text": "5.2 Many limits are found just by evaluating the function\nBefore beginning, it should be noted that for most values of \\(c\\), the answer is simply \\(L=f(c)\\). This is because most all the functions encountered will be continuous which is basically a statement that for any \\(c\\) the limit is given through \\(L=f(c)\\).\nFor example, let \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)/x\\). For any \\(c\\) except \\(0\\), \\(f(x)\\) is continuous and the limit exists and is simply \\(f(c)\\). In particular, at \\(c=1\\) we have\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = \\frac{\\sin(1)}{1}.\n\\]\nHowever, at \\(c=0\\) we can’t say \\(f(x)\\) is continuous – it isn’t even defined. When \\(c\\) is non-zero, the function \\(f(x)\\) is simply the ratio of two continuous functions. Such a ratio will be continuous except when dividing by \\(0\\), as is the case when \\(c=0\\)\nWhen discussing limits of combinations of continuous functions it is generally true that the limit is found by evaluating the function at \\(c\\) unless this yields an indeterminate form which is of the type: \\(0/0\\), \\(\\infty/\\infty\\), \\(0 \\cdot \\infty\\), \\(\\infty - \\infty\\), \\(0^0\\), \\(1^\\infty\\), and \\(\\infty^0\\). Such forms can have limits of many different values, depending on the functions involved.\nFor this particular problem what does Julia return when we try to evaluate \\(f(c)\\)?\n\nf(x) = sin(x)/x\nc = 0\nf(c)\n\nNaN\n\n\nThe value NaN arises when a floating-point computation is indeterminate.\nSo, does \\(\\sin(x)/x\\) have a limit at \\(c=0\\)? If it does, it isn’t simply \\(f(0)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaN values\n\n\n\nOperations involving NaN will also return NaN. In this example, the ratio defining \\(f(x)\\) is like \\(0/0\\) when \\(c=0\\) – an indeterminate form. The value NaN is returned by most of the indeterminate forms listed above, but not all. For example, 0^0 is 1 to Julia:\n“It proved more useful to adhere to the simply stated rule *anything raised to the \\(0\\) gives \\(1\\) then special case \\(0^0\\). Some comments by the “father of floating point” can be read near the end of this.”"

    "text": "5.3 Graphical approach to limits\nA graphical approach to this problem can show if a function is likely to have a limit. The basic idea is to simply make a graph around \\(c\\) and look to see if \\(f(x)\\) gets close to some value as \\(x\\) gets close to \\(c\\):\nusing MTH229\nusing Plots\n\nf(x) = sin(x)/x\nc, delta = 0, pi/2\nplot(f, c - delta, c + delta)\n\n\n\n\nFrom the graph it looks like the function value should be \\(1\\) at \\(0\\). Which is indeed the case, as was understood as early as 1735 by Euler.\nRecall that the graph is made by choosing a large number of points between the limits and then evaluating the function at each of these points. The values \\((x,f(x))\\) are then connected like a dot-to-dot figure. If a value is NaN, the line will break to indicate this. In the above graph, it appears that \\(0\\) is not one of the points sampled, as no break is indicated. The graph gives the appearance that \\(f(x)\\) is continuous, though we know that isn’t the case, as \\(f(x)\\) is undefined at \\(x=0\\).\n\n5.3.1 Removable singularities\nConsider now the following limit\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 2} \\frac{x^2 - 5x + 6}{x^2 +x - 6}\n\\]\nNoting that this is a ratio of continuous functions, we first check whether there is anything to do:\n\nf(x) = (x^2 - 5x + 6) / (x^2 + x - 6)\nc = 2\nf(c)\n\nNaN\n\n\nThe NaN indicates that this function is indeterminate at \\(c=2\\). A quick plot gives us an idea that the limit exists and is roughly \\(-0.2\\):\n\nc, delta = 2, 1\nplot(f, c - delta, c + delta)\n\n\n\n\nThe graph looks continuous. In fact, the value \\(c=2\\) is termed a removable discontinuity as redefining \\(f(x)\\) to be \\(-0.2\\) when \\(x=2\\) results in a continuous function.\nAs an aside, you can redefine f using the “ternary operator”:\n\nf(x) = x == 2.0 ? -0.2 :  (x^2 - 5x + 6) / (x^2 + x - 6)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis particular case is a textbook example: one can easily factor \\(f(x)\\) to get:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{(x-2)(x+3)}\n\\]\nWritten in this form, we clearly see that this is the same function as \\(g(x) = (x-3)/(x+3)\\) when \\(x \\neq 2\\). The function \\(g(x)\\) is continuous at \\(x=2\\). So were one to redefine \\(f(x)\\) at \\(x=2\\) to be \\(g(2) = (2-3)/(2+3) = -0.2\\) it would be made continuous, hence the term removable singularity.\n\n\n5.3.2 Problems\n\nQuestion\nBy graphing near \\(1\\), find the limit:\n\\[\nL = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1}  \\frac{x^2−3x+2}{x^2−6x+5}\n\\]\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nGraphically look at the following limit\n\\[\nL = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow -2} \\frac{x}{x+1} \\frac{x^2}{x^2 + 4}\n\\]\nWhat is the value?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nGraphically investigate the limit\n\\[\nL = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{e^x - 1}{x}.\n\\]\nWhat is the value of \\(L\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nGraphically investigate the limit\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\cos(x) - 1}{x}.\n\\]\nThe limit exists, what is the value?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe following limit is commonly used:\n\\[\nL = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{e^{x + h} - e^x}{h}.\n\\]\nFactoring out \\(e^x\\) from the top and using rules of limits this becomes,\n\\[\nL = e^x \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{e^h - 1}{h}.\n\\]\nWhat is \\(L\\)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n  \n    \\(0\\)\n\n  \n  \n    \\(1\\)\n\n  \n  \n    \\(e^x\\)\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n      The limit part is \\(1\\) not the limit.\n\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe following limit is commonly used:\n\\[\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x + h) - \\sin(x)}{h} = L.\n\\]\nThe answer should depend on \\(x\\), though it is possible it is a constant.

The basic idea is that if\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f(x) = L\n\\]\nthen for values of \\(x\\) close to \\(c\\), we should have that the values of \\(f\\) for these \\(x\\) are close to \\(L\\). For example, let’s look at this limit again:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 2} \\frac{(x+2)(x-3)}{(x+2)(x+3)}\n\\]\nwhich we know is simply \\(-1/5\\). To approach this problem using a table we would first need to produce some values of \\(x\\) getting close to \\(2\\). Here we get values approaching 2 from above:\n\nhs = [1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, 1/10000, 1/100000]  # or [1/10^i for i in 1:5]\nxs = 2 .+ hs\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n 2.1\n 2.01\n 2.001\n 2.0001\n 2.00001\n\n\nThe corresponding \\(y\\) values are found by applying \\(f\\) to each:\n\nf(x) = ((x+2)*(x-3)) / ((x+2)*(x+3))\nys = f.(xs)\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.17647058823529413\n -0.1976047904191617\n -0.19976004799040195\n -0.19997600047999037\n -0.19999760000480002\n\n\nThe ys are clearly getting closer to \\(-0.2\\), as expected.\nThe pairs of values xs and ys can be more naturally displayed with a table, the square-bracket notation is useful here to put the values into two columns:\n\n[xs ys]\n\n5×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 2.1      -0.176471\n 2.01     -0.197605\n 2.001    -0.19976\n 2.0001   -0.199976\n 2.00001  -0.199998\n\n\nThe above investigates the right limit, as the values chosen for xs are always more than 2 but getting closer. The left limit might have used xs defined with:\n\nxs = [2 - 1/10, 2 - 1/100, 2 - 1/1000, 2 - 1/10000, 2 - 1/100000]\nys = f.(xs)\n[xs ys]\n\n5×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 1.9      -0.22449\n 1.99     -0.202405\n 1.999    -0.20024\n 1.9999   -0.200024\n 1.99999  -0.200002\n\n\nWe see the same phenomenon – \\(f(x)\\) gets close to \\(-0.2\\) as \\(x\\) gets close to \\(c=2\\) from the left or the right.\nThe three steps above are bit tedious to type for each problem, so for convenience we encapsulate them into a function (available in the MTH229 package) call lim defined along these lines:\nfunction lim(f::Function, c::Real; n::Int=6, dir=\"+\")\n    hs =  [(1/10)^i for i in 1:n]\n     if dir == \"+\"\n       xs = c .+ hs\n     else\n       xs = c .- hs\n     end\n     ys = f.(xs)\n     [xs ys]\nend\nWe used keywords, n, to allow the user to change how close the xs get to \\(c\\) and dir to indicate the direction. The default direction is from the right.\nNow consider the limit of \\(x^x\\) as \\(x\\) goes to \\(0\\) from the right. Though julia – following a standard – defines this function at \\(0\\), it is of indeterminate form so should be investigated.\n\nf(x) = x^x\nc = 0\nf(c)\n\n1\n\n\nAnd we see that the output from lim agrees with an answer of \\(1\\) for the right limit:\n\nlim(f, c; dir=\"+\")\n\n6×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.1     0.794328\n 0.01    0.954993\n 0.001   0.993116\n 0.0001  0.999079\n 1.0e-5  0.999885\n 1.0e-6  0.999986\n\n\nFor our next example, we compute numerically (a tedious problem to do algebraically)\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 25} \\frac{\\sqrt{x} - 5}{\\sqrt{x-16} - 3}\n\\]\n\nf(x) = (sqrt(x) - 5) / (sqrt(x-16) - 3)\nc = 25\nlim(f, c)\n\n6×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 25.1     0.601062\n 25.01    0.600107\n 25.001   0.600011\n 25.0001  0.600001\n 25.0     0.6\n 25.0     0.6\n\n\nA quick investigation of the table demonstrates the limit should be \\(0.6\\).\n\nExample: The slope of the secant line\nA very important limit in calculus is the derivative formula, written here to emphasize the secant line aspect:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} \\frac{f(x) - f( c)}{x-c}.\n\\]\nLet’s take \\(c = 1\\) and \\(f(x) = x^x\\) and compute the limit above:\n\nf(x) = x^x\nc = 1;\ng(x) = (f(x) - f(c)) / (x - c)\nlim(g, c)\n\n6×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 1.1      1.10534\n 1.01     1.01005\n 1.001    1.001\n 1.0001   1.0001\n 1.00001  1.00001\n 1.0      1.0\n\n\nThe left limit has a similar tale.

At least for most of the output things look okay, but then something goes terribly wrong.\nThe culprit? Floating point approximation involves round off errors.\nLet’s look at the two pieces. First the denominator:\n\ndenominator = [ x^2 for x in xs ]\n\n10-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.010000000000000002\n 0.00010000000000000005\n 1.0000000000000004e-6\n 1.0000000000000004e-8\n 1.0000000000000006e-10\n 1.0000000000000008e-12\n 1.0000000000000006e-14\n 1.0000000000000011e-16\n 1.000000000000001e-18\n 1.0000000000000011e-20\n\n\nThere is nothing here to speak of. Julia’s Float64 type follows the IEEE 754 floating point standard. Of the 64 bits, 1 is used for the sign (plus or minus) and 11 are used to store the exponent. See this informative blog post for more Anatomy of a floating-point number. As \\(2^{11} = 2048\\) roughly half are used for negative exponents, the other half for positive exponents. The range is from 1e-1022 to 1e1023. We aren’t even close to the lower range with 1e-20.\nNow, let’s look at the numerator. The issue is the difference between \\(\\cos(x)\\) and 1.

Hence, when the numerator is divided by even the smallest of numbers, the answer is simply \\(0\\).\nIn general, we add to our few rules of thumb for computation with floating-point numbers:\n\nIf we subtract two like-sized quantities our answer may have dramatically reduced precision.\n\nIn this specific case by the time we get to \\(10^{-8}\\), the difference between \\(\\cos(x)\\) and \\(1\\) is looking to be around 5e-17. However, in floating point representation there are fundamental limits to how close different things can be. Of the 64 bits representing a number, 52 are used for the precision. (A number, \\(s \\cdot p \\cdot 10^e\\), is represented with a sign, the precision and an exponent.) This puts the restriction on what can be represented and ultimately gives a granularity if one looks too closely – without working harder. In this particular case, the floating point approximation for \\(1\\) and that for \\(\\cos(x)\\) are eventually the same value – even if they are different mathematically.\nThe value\n\neps()\n\n2.220446049250313e-16\n\n\nmeasures how much larger the next representable number after \\(1.0\\) is from \\(1.0\\). (Of course, this has no answer in the real numbers, but floating point is a discrete approximation.)\nWhat has happened with \\(1-\\cos(x)\\) is the mathematical value of \\(\\cos(x)\\) gets too close to 1 when \\(x = 10^{-8}\\) and so the difference is treated as \\(0\\) as the two numbers have the same representation. Since \\(0\\) divided by any non-zero number is zero, we get a reasonable answer for the at-first unexpected behavior.\nSo be careful, we can get too close when looking “close.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating how numbers are represented in floating point: prevfloat\n\n\n\nJulia has some functions for working with floating point numbers. Some of you might be thinking that since eps is the difference to the next representable number larger than 1, what is the same for the next representable number less than one. The prevfloat value gives this. Here we see the issue between \\(10^{-7}\\) and \\(10^{-8}\\):\n\n\nprevfloat(1.0) < cos(1e-7)\nprevfloat(1.0) < cos(1e-8)\nFloating point approximations differ depending on the location. Look at the difference between 1.0- prevfloat(1.0) and nextfloat(1.0) - 1. Then look at how small nextfloat(0.0) is.\n\n5.7.1 Practice\n\nQuestions\nis eps() == nextfloat(1.0)?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        true\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        false\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion (bitstring etc)\nThe bitstring function prints the bit representation of a number. For real numbers, the first bit is the sign, the next 11 the exponent and the last 52 are for the precision.

    "section": "5.8 Symbolic answers",
    "text": "5.8 Symbolic answers\nThe SymPy package for Julia provides a means to for Julia users to interact with the SymPy add-on for the Python programming language. This package is loaded by the MTH229 package. The SymPy package provides symbolic math features. One such feature is the ability to perform symbolically the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(c\\).\nThe limit function accesses these features. Its basic use is straightforward, just pass a symbolic expression, and indicate the variable going to c:\n\n@syms x\nf(x) = sin(x)/x\nc = 0\nlimit(f(x), x=>c)\n\n \n\\[\n1\n\\]\n\n\n\nOr, with a limit at infinity\n\nf(x) = (1 + 1/x)^x\nc = oo                 # oo is symbolic infinity. Can also use Inf.\nlimit(f(x), x=>c)\n\n \n\\[\ne\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe latter shows the results are not quite real numbers. Rather, they are symbolic values. We aren’t discussing these here, but the values are readily apparent.\nThe command @syms x creates x as a symbolic variable. The call f(x) returns a symbolic expression. These can also be created directly, as with sin(x)/x.\nThe limit function has one named argument, dir, used to adjust if a left, right (the default) limit is sought. For example, this function has different left and right limits at 0:\n\nf(x) = sign(x)\n@syms x\nlimit(f(x), x=>0, dir=\"-\"), limit(f(x), x=>0, dir=\"+\")\n\n(-1, 1)\n\n\nThe algorithm implemented in SymPy for symbolic limits is quite powerful. It does not suffer from the floating point issues described before and gives exact values (though some coercion to floating point is possible). The following example shows this:\nThis function is pretty devious:\n\nf(x) = 1/ x^(log(log(log(log(1/x)))) - 1)\n\nf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nIt has a right limit at \\(c=0\\), but not what is expected, which might appear to be 0:\n\nxs = [0 + 1/10^i for i in 2:6]\nys = f.(xs)\n[xs ys]\n\n5×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.01    0.000191087\n 0.001   5.60275e-5\n 0.0001  1.24647e-5\n 1.0e-5  2.73214e-6\n 1.0e-6  6.14632e-7\n\n\nBut in fact the limit is quite different from \\(0\\):\nlimit(f(x), x => 0, dir=\"+\")\n\n5.8.1 limits with parameters\nConsider the limit\n\\[\nL = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{b^x - 1}{x}.\n\\]\nIt’s answer depends on the value of \\(b\\). How would we approach this with SymPy? The interface described above where functions are used is not the only one SymPy knows of, and indeed is not typical of how one works with SymPy. Typically, symbolic values are defined and then symbolic expressions are used.\nHere is how we define a symbolic value (in fact two):\n\n@syms x b\n\n(x, b)\n\n\nAnd here is how we use them:\n\nlimit((b^x - 1) / x, x=>0)\n\n \n\\[\n\\log{\\left(b \\right)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe see the \\(\\log(b)\\) value “magically” appearing.

    "section": "6.1 Introduction",
    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nWe load our packages to begin.\nusing MTH229\nusing Plots\nSingle-variable calculus has two main concepts: the derivative and the integral, both defined in terms of a third important concept: the limit. The derivative is what we discuss here. The derivative allows us to talk about a tangent line to a curve. This is often called a line that touches the curve at just one point, but that isn’t quite correct, though often the case locally. A better idea would be to say it is the line that best approximates the curve at that point. That is, if we were to zoom in to the graph it might appear to look straight, and that straightness would have a slope that would match the tangent line. This idea leads to a primary use of the derivative – to approximate functions with simpler lines. Of course, this intuition is informal, a definition is in terms of the slope of approximating secant lines.\nHistorically, Fermat, in a treatise on finding maxima and minima, approached the problem of finding the tangent line by comparing the value of \\(f(x)\\) to a nearby value \\(f(x+h)\\). Working with polynomials, meant that subtracting \\(f(x+h) - f(x)\\) led to a polynomial in \\(h\\). Dividing by \\(h\\) and then setting \\(h=0\\) yields an answer for the slope.\nThe more modern approach (well Cauchy in the 1820s) defines the derivative of a function, \\(f\\), at a point \\(c\\) as the slope of the tangent line, defined in terms of the limit of the slopes of approximating secant lines. The notation is:\n\\[\nf'( c ) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(c + h) - f( c)}{h}.\\quad\\text{Derivative at a point}\n\\]\nAs mentioned, intuitively, the tangent line is the best straight-line approximation to a function near the point \\((c, f( c))\\) and would have slope given by the derivative.\nThis graph shows \\(f(x) = 2 - x^2\\) and various secant lines when \\(c=-0.75\\).\n\nf(x) = 2 - x^2\nc = -0.75\nsec_line(h) = secant(f, c, c+h)                # secant in MTH229 package\nplot(f, -1, 1, legend=false)\nplot!(sec_line(1))\nplot!(sec_line(0.75))\nplot!(sec_line(0.5))\nplot!(sec_line(0.25))\n\n\n\n\nAs the value of \\(h\\) goes towards 0 along the path \\(1\\), \\(0.75\\), \\(0.5\\), \\(0.25\\), … the slope of the secant line heads towards the slope of the tangent line, in this case \\(2\\cdot 0.75 = 1.5\\).\nUsing the idea of a derivative at a point, one defines the derivative of the function \\(f\\) to be the function which for each \\(x\\) returns the derivative of \\(f\\) at the point \\(x\\). Notationally, this just replaces \\(c\\) above with \\(x\\), but conceptually there is a bit more to it."

    "text": "6.2 Forward difference quotients, Slope of the tangent line\nThe rules of derivatives allow for a mechanical approach to taking derivatives with the power rule, chain rule and some special cases. In this project we look at approaching the derivative numerically. We start by investigating approximate derivatives computed with finite difference quotients.\nThe most naive approximation is simply to assume \\(h\\) is some small number and use that to approximate the limit above:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2x; fp(x) = 2x - 2\nh = .001\nc = 3\n( f(c + h) - f(c) ) / h\n\n4.000999999999699\n\n\nThis is known as the forward difference quotient approximation to the derivative. For this example, the difference between the approximation and the actual slope is:\n\n( f(c + h) - f(c) ) / h - fp(c)\n\n0.0009999999996992415\n\n\nThat is not too close, just to 3 digits of accuracy.\nNotationally, we may write this as:\n\\[\nf'( c) \\approx \\frac{f(c + h) - f( c) }{h}\n\\]\nFor some small value of \\(h\\). The equals sign is replaced by an approximation symbol, as there is no limit expression written.\n\nExample Derivative at a point\nLet’s try the derivative of some well known function. We know the derivative of \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = \\cos(x)\\). Let’s see if the above works well:\n\nf(x) = sin(x); fp(x) = cos(x)\nc = pi/4; h = 0.0001\n( f(c + h) - f(c) )/h - fp(c)\n\n-3.535651724428934e-5\n\n\nNot as good as we can get – the error is like 1e-5, but not too bad already.\n\n\nExample Finding profit\nSuppose the tractor company John Deere models its profit per units sold through the function \\(P(x) = 50 e^{x/250}/(1 - e^{x/250})\\). Find the marginal profit for \\(x=200\\).\nThe marginal profit is the change in profit per unit sold – or the derivative – at \\(x=200\\). We can find this quite simply by either differentiating directly, or as we do here, approximating the answer with julia. We first note that the function above, is a composition, so it may be written using two functions:\n\nf1(x) = exp(x)/(1 - exp(x))\nf(x) = 50 * f1(x/250)\nc = 200; h = 0.0001;\nres = (f(c+h) - f(c))/h\n\n0.29635326299626286\n\n\nIf \\(50\\) is the maximum profit, this is a percentage increase of:\n\n(res/50) * 100\n\n0.5927065259925257\n\n\nor a bit more than half a percent.\n\n\nExample Finding the tangent line at a point\nLet \\(f(x) = x^x\\). Find the tangent line at \\(c=2\\). Compare the difference between the value of the tangent line and the function at \\(x=2.1\\).\nThe tangent line is most easily expressed in terms of the point-slope formula for a line where the point is \\((c, f( c))\\) and the slope is \\(f'( c)\\). This gives:\n\\[\ny = f( c) + f'( c)\\cdot(x - c)\n\\]\nIn the following, the slope of the tangent line will be approximated using a numeric derivative.

Mathematically, from this viewpoint, the derivative is referred to as an operator, as it takes a function and returns a function.\nWe can reproduce this behavior easily enough with julia, as functions are first class objects: they can be passed as arguments and returned as values.\nFirst, let’s define a function to find the derivative at a point using the “forward difference quotient”:\n\nforward_difference(f, x0, h) = (f(x0 + h) - f(x0))/h\n\nforward_difference (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWe need three arguments of course as we have three ingredients to worry about: the function, the point and the size of \\(h\\).\nTo make an operator that takes \\(f\\) and returns a function (an anonymous function in this case) that computes our approximation to \\(f'\\) we can do the following:\n\nDf(f; h=1e-8) = x -> forward_difference(f, x, h)\n\nDf (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWe specified a default value of \\(h\\) for convenience, but allow it to be varied if desired.\nTo see this work, we can find and plot the derivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\):\n\nf(x) = sin(x)\nfp(x) = Df(f)(x)\nplot(f, 0, 2pi)\nplot!(fp)\n\n\n\n\nWell, we already knew that should just be \\(\\cos(x)\\). The point is we can easily make the an approximate derivative function from f with the definition fp(x) = Df(f)(x).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParsing Df(f)(x)\n\n\n\nSeeing the pair of parenthesis can lead to confusion, as it isn’t common math notation. Here parentheses are not used for grouping, but rather function application. There are two function applications and the associativity rules for function application are left to right, as with most – but not all – operations. So Df(f) is done first. This returns a function (the approximate derivative) which is then evaluated at x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining fp or fp(x)\n\n\n\nWe could also have just plotted f and Df(f) without naming fp. As well, could have written fp = Df(f), but that creates fp as an anonymous function and we then couldn’t redefine it through fp(x) = ..., which would attempt to make it a generic function.\n\n\nLet’s look at a different function, where we don’t know in our heads the answer.\n\nf(x) = exp(x)/(1 + exp(x))\nplot(f, 0, 5)\nplot!(Df(f))\n\n\n\n\nIf we look, we can see from the graph that f is increasing and Df(f) is positive – this is no coincidence, of course.\n\nExample: Critical points\nA function’s critical points are where its derivative is \\(0\\) or undefined. We can examine these by graphing the function’s derivative. Let’s do so for the polynomial \\(f(x) = x^3 - 5x + 4\\):\n\nf(x) = x^3 -5x + 4\nfp(x) = Df(f)(x)\nplot(fp, -5, 5)\n\n\n\n\nYou can check the zeroes graphically, say by zooming in a bit and adding the line \\(y=0\\):\n\nplot(fp, -2, 2)\nplot!(zero)\n\n\n\n\nIf you want, we can find the roots numerically. For example,\n\nfind_zeros(fp, -10, 10)\n\n2-element Vector{Float64}:\n -1.290994449095253\n  1.2909944355487426\n\n\n\n\nExample: When is a function increasing?\nLet \\(f(x) = \\cos(x)\\) over the interval \\([0, 360]\\) (in degrees). When is the function increasing?\nFrom the relationship of the derivative and the function, we know the answer is when \\(f'(x) > 0\\). For this example, we can solve this directly as \\(f'(x) = -\\sin(x)\\) and we know when that is positive (well you are supposed to anyways: when the angle is in the third and fourth quadrants). Let’s see how we would do this task with julia and compare.\nFirst, we only need the derivative, so we just ask:\n\nf(x) = cosd(x)          # using degrees\nfp(x) = Df(f)(x)                # use default h\n\nfp (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThen we wish to indicate on the graph where fp(x) > 0. We can do this by defining a function that is \\(0\\) when that is the case and NaN otherwise (so that those points are not plotted). We do so below using the plotif function from the MTH229 package\n\nplotif(f, fp, 0, 360)  # second color when fp > 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.1 Practice\n\nQuestion\nLet \\(f(x) = e^x\\).

    "text": "6.4 Improvements to the basic forward difference quotient\nThe error in the approximation of the derivative depends on the size of \\(h\\). Mathematically, as \\(h\\) gets smaller we get better approximations, though with the computer other complications arise. To see mathematically that this is the case, let’s look at the difference between the approximate numeric derivative from the forward difference quotient and a known derivative.\n\nf(x) = sin(x)\nfp(x) = cos(x)\n[ Df(f,h=h)(.5) - fp(.5) for h=[.1, .01, .001, .0001, .00001] ]\n\n5-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.0254132139820491\n -0.0024117340199198978\n -0.00023985901305767499\n -2.3972739644051444e-5\n -2.3971472203898614e-6\n\n\nIt gets better as \\(h\\) gets smaller. In fact, it looks like when \\(h\\) gets smaller by a factor of \\(1/10\\) so does the error. Let’s look a little deeper though. Rather than type in the values of \\(h\\) as above, let’s use an expression to compute them. Here we find the powers \\(10^{-1}, \\dots, 10^{-16}\\) at once and then compute the differences:\n\nhs = [(1/10)^i for i in 1:16];\nout = [ Df(f,h=h)(.5) - fp(.5) for h in hs ];\n[hs out]\n\n16×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.1      -0.0254132\n 0.01     -0.00241173\n 0.001    -0.000239859\n 0.0001   -2.39727e-5\n 1.0e-5   -2.39715e-6\n 1.0e-6   -2.3969e-7\n 1.0e-7   -2.4695e-8\n 1.0e-8    2.85032e-10\n 1.0e-9    2.85032e-10\n 1.0e-10  -1.10737e-7\n 1.0e-11  -1.22096e-6\n 1.0e-12  -6.77208e-6\n 1.0e-13   4.87391e-5\n 1.0e-14  -0.000506372\n 1.0e-15   0.0105959\n 1.0e-16   0.23264\n\n\nWhen we look, we see that for awhile the approximation gets better (to about 1e-9), but then does a U-turn and starts getting worse. The mathematical approximation gets better and better, but what happens is the computational error gets worse. We’ll see below how to pick the \\(h\\) that best balances these off, but first lets look at how using different approximations for the derivative can improve the “mathematical” error.\n\n6.4.1 Central difference quotient\nIt turns out that just by looking to the left and the right we can improve the mathematical error from getting better at a rate of \\(h\\) to a rate of \\(h^2\\), provided our function is smooth enough and we don’t have issues on the boundaries. The formula, called the central difference quotient approximation to the derivative is:\n\\[\nf'(x) \\approx \\frac{ f(x + h) - f(x - h) }{2h}\n\\]\nFor this the mathematical error is like \\(h^2\\), not \\(h\\).\nLet’s compare. To make our life easier we again create some functions, as we did with Df above.\n\ncentral_difference(f, x0, h) = (f(x0 + h) - f(x0 - h)) / (2h)\nDc(f; h=0.0001) = x -> central_difference(f, x, h)\n\nDc (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nNow to see whether a forward difference quotient or central difference quotient works better. We can do so with a table. Again with \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\)\n\nf(x) = sin(x)\nfp(x) = cos(x)\nusing_D =  [ Df(f,h=h)(.5) - fp(.5) for h in hs ];\nusing_Dc = [ Dc(f,h=h)(.5) - fp(.5) for h in hs ];\n[hs using_D using_Dc]\n\n16×3 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.1      -0.0254132    -0.00146191\n 0.01     -0.00241173   -1.46263e-5\n 0.001    -0.000239859  -1.46264e-7\n 0.0001   -2.39727e-5   -1.46274e-9\n 1.0e-5   -2.39715e-6   -1.75036e-11\n 1.0e-6   -2.3969e-7     7.47635e-12\n 1.0e-7   -2.4695e-8    -2.70079e-10\n 1.0e-8    2.85032e-10   2.85032e-10\n 1.0e-9    2.85032e-10   2.85032e-10\n 1.0e-10  -1.10737e-7   -1.10737e-7\n 1.0e-11  -1.22096e-6   -1.22096e-6\n 1.0e-12  -6.77208e-6   -6.77208e-6\n 1.0e-13   4.87391e-5    4.87391e-5\n 1.0e-14  -0.000506372  -0.000506372\n 1.0e-15   0.0105959     0.0105959\n 1.0e-16   0.23264       0.23264\n\n\nThe errors for the central difference quotient are either much smaller for the same size \\(h\\) or the same. We see that we can use a larger \\(h\\) to get the most accuracy in this example.\n\nExample: When does the tangent line hit 0?\nLet \\(f(x) = 10/(1+x^2) - 10\\exp(-(1/2)x^2)\\).

    "text": "6.5 Automatic differentiation\nWe discuss now Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation.\nAutomatic differentiation avoids the numeric instability issues of finite difference quotients by using a different approach. Whereas finite difference quotientss have a long history, automatic differentiation only dates back to the 50s.\nThe ForwardDiff package implements automatic differentiation.\nThe MTH229 package overloads the idea of ', so uses automatic differentiation when the notation f' is encountered.\nThat means, we can find derivatives, as familiarly as:\n\nf(x) = x^x\nf'(1)\n\n1.0\n\n\nHere f is a function, f' is a derived function, and f'(1) is this derived function evaluated at 1 – just as with the use within a math text book.\nUnlike, finite difference quotients automatic differentiation does not have issues arising from the loss of precision encountered when subtracting two like-sized numbers. Unlike symbolic derivatives (such as those found by the Wolfram Alpha website used by your iPhone’s Siri) they can be computed quickly, even if the computations defining the function involve many steps.\nSo what is automatic differentiation? The idea of the forward mode is quite intuitive. The tangent line approximation of a function at the point \\(c\\) becomes\n\\[\nf(x) = f(c) + f'( c)(x-c) + O((x-c)^2)\n\\]\nWhere the notation \\(O(x-c)^2\\) means that the last term is not precisely spelled out, but is like some constant times the difference \\((x-c)^2\\). This has many applications, but for this one it reduces the knowledge of the function values at this level to two values \\((f(c), f'(c))\\)\nNow consider the product of two functions \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\)? The above formula applied to \\(f \\cdot g\\) is:\n\\[\n(f\\cdot g)(x) = f(c) \\cdot g(c) + (f'( c)g( c) + f( c)g'( c))(x-c) + O((x-c)^2)\n\\]\nThis follows by the product rule. Again we have that two values determine the product \\(f\\cdot g\\) at this level, these being \\((f(c) \\cdot g(c)\\), and \\(f'( c)g( c) + f( c)g'( c)\\). But, this combination can be made from the values \\((f(c), f'(c))\\) and \\((g(c), g'(c))\\) which represent \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). Hence it is enough to know the two values for \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) to compute the two values for \\(f\\cdot g\\).\nIn fact, the rules of derivatives allow us to say the same for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers and composition. For composition this is from the chain rule:\n\\[\n(f \\circ g)(x) = (f \\circ g)(c) + f'( g(c)) g'(c) (x-c) + O((x-c)^2).\n\\]\nAutomatic differentiation can be implemented by extending how we store a value, storing both \\((x, dx)\\) as above. With this, the rules of differentials inform us how we combine these values. For example:\n\n\\[\n(x, dx) + (y, dy) = (x + y, d(x+y)) = (x + y, 1dx +  1dy)\n\\]\n\\[\n(x, dx) \\cdot (y, dy) = (xy, d(xy)) = (xy, y dx + x dy)\n\\]\n\\[\n(x, dx)^n = (x^n, d(x^n)) = (x^n, n x^{n-1} dx)\n\\]\n\netc.\nFor functions we need to use the chain rule:\n\n\\[\nf((x, dx)) = (f(x), d(f(x))) = (f(x), f'(x) dx )\n\\]\n\n\n6.5.1 Examples\nUsing ', we see that plotting a function and its derivative is straightforward:\n\nf(x) = exp(-x)*sin(x)\nplot(f, 0, 2pi)\nplot!(f')\n\n\n\n\nSecond derivatives are also available:\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2x\nplot(f, -2, 2)\nplot!(f')\nplot!(f'')\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example where we plot the tangent line and the function. The MTH229 package provides this function to compute a tangent line function:\ntangent(f, c) = x -> f(c) + f'(c)*(x-c)\nThis is employed as follows:\n\nf(x) = x^x\nc = 1\nplot(f, 1/2, 2)\nplot!(tangent(f, c))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: AP Calculus question\nThe 2014 AP Calculus exam included this question:\nGrass clippings are placed in a bin, where they decompose. For \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 30\\), the amount of grass clippings remaining in the bin is modeled by \\(A(t) = 6.687(0.931)^t\\). Where \\(A(t)\\) is measured in pounds and \\(t\\) is measured in days.\n\nFind the average rate of change of \\(A(t)\\) over the interval of \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 30\\). Indicate units of measure.\nFind the value of \\(A'(15)\\). Using correct units, interpret the meaning of the value in the context of the problem.\nFind the time \\(t\\) for which the amount of grass clippings in the bin is equal to the average amount of grass clippings in the bin over the interval \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 30\\).\nFor \\(t > 30\\), \\(L(t)\\), the linear approximation to \\(A\\) at \\(t=30\\) is a better model for the amount of grass clippings remaining in the bin. Use \\(L(t)\\) to predict the time at which there will be 0.5% pound of grass clippings remaining in the bin. Show the work that leads to your answer.\n\nWe can do all this relatively quickly with the find_zero function from the Roots package.\nFirst, we define \\(A(t)\\):\n\nA(t) = 6.687 * (0.931)^t\n\nA (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThe first question is answered by the slope of the secant line connecting \\((0,A(0))\\) and \\((30, A(30))\\):\n\nm = (A(30) - A(0)) / (30 - 0)\n\n-0.1968024043540685\n\n\nThe units are in pounds per day.\nThe second question is done through the derivative, as follows:\n\nA'(15)\n\n-0.1635905803884566\n\n\nThis also has units in pounds per day. This is the instantaneous rate of decomposition, and is less (in absolute value) than the average decay rate.\nThe mean value theorem tells us that there is at least one time where the instantaneous decomposition rate equals the average rate over the interval \\([0,30]\\). Thus the endpoints form a bracketing interval for the equation \\(A'(t) = m\\), which we solve with:\n\nfind_zero(t -> A'(t) - m, (0, 30))\n\n12.414773526372592\n\n\nSo at 12.4 days, the instantaneous rate is equal to the average rate of decomposition over the first 30 days.\nBut this doesn’t really answer the question asked, which is about the average amount of grass clippings in the bin. For this we need the integral form of the mean value theorem. Skipping ahead a few lessons to solve this problem, we have:\n\na, err = quadgk(A, 0, 30)   # area under A from 0,30\navg = a/(30-0)\nfind_zero(t -> A(t) - avg, (0, 30))\n\n12.414773526372596\n\n\nWe get the same answer – think about whether that is a coincidence.\nFinally, we can define \\(L(t)\\) using the point-slope form of the line. The point is \\((30, A(30))\\) and the slope is \\(A'(30)\\):\n\nL(t) = A(30) + A'(30) * (t - 30) # t > 30\n\nL (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nWe could restrict \\(L\\) to insist that \\(t > 30\\), but this isn’t necessary.

    "text": "6.6 Error analysis\nWe end with a digression on how big h should be to have the approximate derivatives as close as can be.\nThe choice of \\(h\\) in the derivative approximations above was done somewhat arbitrarily, with only the intuition that smaller \\(h\\)’s should produce more accurate approximations (which of course may be way off, as we are subtracting like-sized values in the derivative formula). Here we look a bit more closely at how to choose \\(h\\).\nAs mentioned, with a bit of work from the second semester of calculus one can learn that the mathematical error in the forward difference quotient is “order \\(h\\)” whereas the mathematical error in the central difference quotient is “order \\(h^2\\). This means that as \\(h\\) gets small the approximation error in the first is a multple of \\(h\\), but for the second a multiple of \\(h^2\\) – a much smaller error in general.\nHowever there is also error due to floating point approximation. Such error is different in that it gets bigger as \\(h\\) gets smaller. So one error gets bigger, the other gets smaller. So clearly if \\(h\\) gets too small, the floating point error will dominate and the overall error will not get smaller, rather larger.\nSo, how big is the floating point error? For any given number, it can be roughly as big as the the machine precision amount, \\(\\epsilon\\). So in the forward-difference quotient approximation we could have errors in both terms \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\) so the total error could be as big as \\(2\\epsilon\\). But this is divided by \\(h\\) as we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} = \\frac{float(f(x +h)) + \\epsilon - float(f(x_) + \\epsilon}{h} =\n         \\frac{float(f(x+h))-float(f(x))}{h} + \\frac{2\\epsilon}{h}.\n\\]\nThe errors may or may not cancel so the algebra with \\(\\epsilon\\) is unusual to the untrained eye. It basically takes into account the worse case.\nThe key is the \\(2\\epsilon/h\\) term – it gets bigger as \\(h\\) gets smaller.\nSo if each floating point approximation is no more off than \\(\\epsilon\\), we have this bound on the error:\n\\[\n\\text{error} \\leq \\frac{2\\epsilon}{h} + (M/2)h\n\\]\nWhere \\(M\\) is a constant that depends on the maximum absolute value of the second derivative and the \\(1/2\\) comes from second semester calculus. Choosing \\(h\\) to make this as small as possible is possible with some calculus involving the derivative, but for now we simply note the answer is \\(h=((2\\epsilon)/(M/2))^{1/2}\\).\nTaking \\(\\epsilon\\) as machine tolerance and (conveniently) \\(M=1\\) we get\n\\[\nh_{min} = \\sqrt((2\\epsilon)/(1/2)) \\approx 10^{-8}\n\\]\nOr more precisely:\n\nsqrt( (2*eps())/(1/2) )\n\n2.9802322387695312e-8\n\n\nWe can check this is about right,but graphing on a different scale:\n\nf(h; M=1) = 2*eps()/h + (M/2)*h\ng(x) = log10(f(10.0^(-x)))\nplot(g, 1, 10)          # min near 8, which means h like 1e-8\n\n\n\n\nNumerically, we can check how this basically works for some test function:\n\nf(x) = exp(x) - x^3\nfp(x) = exp(x) - 3x^2\n[hs [Df(f,h=h)(.5) - fp(.5) for h in hs] ]\n\n16×2 Matrix{Float64}:\n 0.1      -0.074746\n 0.01     -0.00682885\n 0.001    -0.000676365\n 0.0001   -6.75712e-5\n 1.0e-5   -6.75649e-6\n 1.0e-6   -6.75645e-7\n 1.0e-7   -6.65768e-8\n 1.0e-8    4.47752e-9\n 1.0e-9   -1.73158e-7\n 1.0e-10  -1.73158e-7\n 1.0e-11   4.26773e-6\n 1.0e-12  -0.000106755\n 1.0e-13   0.000559379\n 1.0e-14  -0.0105429\n 1.0e-15  -0.0105429\n 1.0e-16   1.32172\n\n\nWe see the best case is around \\(h=10^{-8}\\), as expected by the theory.\n\n6.6.1 Approximation errors for the central difference quotient\nFor the central difference quotient, the errors are different.

    "text": "7.4 Classifying critical points\nThe first- and second-derivative tests are a means to classify if a critical point is also a local extrema. A local extrema will always correspond to a critical point – but not necessarily vice versa. There are two theorems that ensure a critical point will be a local extrema:\n\nThe first derivative test\nIf \\(c\\) is a critical point and \\(f'(x)\\) changes sign at \\(x=c\\), then \\((c,f( c))\\) will be a local extrema. (If the sign change is from positive to negative, it will be a local maximum.) If there is no sign change, the critical point is not a local extrema.\n\n\nThe second derivative test\nIf \\(c\\) is a critical point and \\(f''(x) \\neq 0\\) then \\((c,f( c))\\) will be a local extrema. If \\(f''( c) > 0\\) this will be a local minimum and if \\(f''( c) < 0\\) a local maximum. (Nothing conclusive can be said when \\(f''(c)=0\\).)\n\n\nFor example, let \\(f(x) = 2\\sin(x) + \\cos(2x)\\). Find all critical points on \\([0, 2\\pi]\\).\nAs \\(f(x)\\) is everywhere differentiable, these critical points would be where the derivative is \\(0\\). A plot helps us identify how many and roughly where:\n\nf(x) = 2sin(x) + cos(2x)\nplot(f', 0, 2pi)\n\n\n\n\nWe see four: one near 0.8, one near 1.5, one near 2.5 and one near\n\nWe use find_zeros to identify:\n\n\ncps = find_zeros(f', 0, 6)\n\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.5235987755982988\n 1.5707963267948966\n 2.617993877991494\n 4.71238898038469\n\n\nUse the first derivative test to classify these values as relative maximum or minimum. From the graph of f' we see at the first one the derivative is changing sign from positive to negative at the first one (hence a local maximum), and this alternates as we go along.\nThe MTH229 package has a sign_chart function to do check numerically for sign changes of a function:\n\nsign_chart(f', 0, 4)\n\n3-element Vector{NamedTuple{(:DNE_0_∞, :sign_change), Tuple{Float64, String}}}:\n (DNE_0_∞ = 0.5235987755982988, sign_change = \"+ → -\")\n (DNE_0_∞ = 1.5707963267948966, sign_change = \"- → +\")\n (DNE_0_∞ = 2.617993877991494, sign_change = \"+ → -\")\n\n\nSo by the first derivative test we have a max, min, max, min which we see when we plot f:\n\nplot(f, 0, 2pi)\n\n\n\n\nTo get the same from the second derivative test, we evaluate \\(f''(x)\\) at these four points:\n\nf''.(cps)\n\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n -3.0000000000000004\n  2.0\n -2.9999999999999982\n  6.0\n\n\n(Using the dot broadcasts f'' over all the values in cps.)\nIf you wanted something fancy, you could convert using sign:\n\n[\"max\", \"can't tell\", \"min\"][2 .+ Int.(sign.(f''.(cps)))]\n\n4-element Vector{String}:\n \"max\"\n \"min\"\n \"max\"\n \"min\"\n\n\n\nQuestion\nLet \\(f'(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 1\\).

    "text": "8.1 Introduction\nNewton’s method is an old method for approximating a zero of a function, \\(f(x)\\):\n\\[\nf(x) = 0\n\\]\nPreviously we discussed the bisection method which applied for some continuous function \\(f(x)\\) which changed signs between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), points which bracket a zero. Not only did we need to find these bracketing points – which wasn’t hard from a graph, more importantly the actual algorithm is pretty slow.\nIf the function \\(f\\) is sufficiently differentiable, then Newton’s method may work to find a zero. Unlike the bisection method which is slow but guaranteed to find a root by the intermediate value theorem, Newton’s method is fast (once it is close) but has no such guarantee of converging. In this project, we’ll see how to implement the algorithm, try some examples, and then look at what can go wrong.\nThe MTH229 package provides a function newton for easily performing Newton’s method, utilizing a function from the Roots package. More usefully, we will see that find_zero, which we used for bisection, can also be used for root finding with an algorithm that is a bit more robust than Newton’s method.\nTo begin, we load MTH229 and Plots. In the background this loads Roots:\nusing MTH229\nusing Plots"

    "section": "8.2 Basic idea",
    "text": "8.2 Basic idea\nThe idea behind Newton’s method is simple – linear approximation. That is, most functions at any given point are well approximated by the tangent line at that point. If we have a good guess \\(x_n\\), then we can improve this guess iteratively by replacing it with the zero, \\(x_{n+1}\\), of the tangent line at \\((x_n, f(x_n))\\).\n\n\n\nNewton, one step\n\n\nA simple picture shows that we have a triangle with base \\(x_{n+1} - x_{n}\\), rise \\(0 - f(x_n)\\) and slope \\(f'(x_n)\\), using the “rise over run” formula:\n\\[\nf'(x_n) = \\frac{-f(x_n)}{x_{n+1} - x_{n}}.\n\\]\nThe basic algorithm of Newton’s methods solves this to get:\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.\n\\]\nSome books write the right-hand side as \\(x_n - f'(x_n)^{-1} f(x_n)\\), a form that generalizes to different settings.\nLike the bisection method, Newton’s method is an iterative method. One begins with a (suitable) guess \\(x_0\\). From that the algorithm produces \\(x_1\\) which is used to produce \\(x_2\\), etc. The idea is that one eventually will settle on a value \\(x_n\\) sufficiently close to the desired root.\nMathematically, the indices indicate that the right hand side is computed and assigned to the left hand side. This is exactly what is done in assignment within julia, so the above simply becomes:\nx = x - f(x)/f'(x)\nWhere f(x) is the function and f'(x) its derivative. (In this case found by automatic differentiation.) This line starts with a previously defined value of x and updates it accordingly.\nThe updating is continued – by executing the exact same command – until either the algorithm has gotten close enough to an answer (i.e., it has converged) or we have given up on it converging.\nHere is an example to find a zero of the function: \\(f(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5\\).\nA quick graph shows a root near 2:\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5\nplot(f, -3, 3)\n\n\n\n\nHere we improve the estimate for the root near 2 using Newton’s method. We will need the first derivative, which we denote fp\n\nfp(x) = 3x^2 - 2\nx = 2               # starting value, x_0\nx = x - f(x)/fp(x)      # new value, x_1\nx, f(x)\n\n(2.1, 0.06100000000000083)\n\n\nWe can visualize our progress as follows, noting that x holds \\(x_1\\), and zooming into the domain \\([1,3]\\):\n\nx0, x1 = 2, x\nplot(f, 1, 3, legend=false)\nplot!([x0, x0, x1], [0, f(x0), 0])  # why these values?\nscatter!([x0, x1], [0, 0])\n\n\n\n\nContinuing, though without visualizing the progress, this next step will compute \\(x_2\\):\n\nx = x - f(x)/fp(x)\nx, f(x)\n\n(2.094568121104185, 0.00018572317327247845)\n\n\nThis next step will compute \\(x_3\\):\n\nx = x - f(x)/fp(x)\nx, f(x)\n\n(2.094551481698199, 1.7397612239733462e-9)\n\n\nThis next step will compute \\(x_4\\):\n\nx = x - f(x)/fp(x)\nx, f(x)\n\n(2.0945514815423265, -8.881784197001252e-16)\n\n\nThis next step will compute \\(x_5\\):\n\nx = x - f(x)/fp(x)      # x stopped changing\nx, f(x)\n\n(2.0945514815423265, -8.881784197001252e-16)\n\n\nWe see that \\(x_4=x_5\\), so the algorithm has stabilized. We also see that \\(f(x_4)\\) is basically \\(0\\) (Recall, eps() is the machine precision, or the size of the difference between floating point values at \\(1.0\\) is basically \\(10^{-16}\\), the size of \\(f(x_4)\\).)\nYou can see in this case that the convergence happens quickly as soon as the algorithm gets close.\nThe approximate root is \\(x_4\\). It is important to realize that the actual, exact, answer is not likely to be the value computed by Newton’s method, which we call xstar at times. In most cases, the true answer will be irrational and xstar a floating point number, which ultimately can never be better than an approximation to an irrational number.\nThe above example iterated until it was clear the algorithm does not improve itself, as the values returned did not change. This need not be the case for every problem.\nRather, we can determine two ways that the number is close enough to the answer:\n\nThe sequence of x’s stop changing by much\nthe values f(x) get close enough to zero.\n\nIn the above, the first one was used. In either case, rather than look for values to be equal (e.g. \\(x_{n+1} = x_{n}\\) or \\(f(x_n) = 0\\), we look at whether these two things are close enough to be so. That means for some tolerance, we stop when the change in the x’s is smaller than the tolerance or f(x) is smaller – in absolute value – than the tolerance.\n\n8.2.1 Repeating steps\nThe above approach – basically repeating steps – can be tedious. There will be a function to do this for you (newton). One can use copy and paste to do much of this though:\n\nf(x) = x^3 - 2x - 5\nx = 2\nx = x - f(x)/f'(x)\nx = x - f(x)/f'(x)\nx = x - f(x)/f'(x)\nx = x - f(x)/f'(x)\nx = x - f(x)/f'(x)\n\n(x, f(x))\n\n(2.0945514815423265, -8.881784197001252e-16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNewton looked at this same example in 1699 (B.T. Polyak, Newton’s method and its use in optimization, European Journal of Operational Research. 02/2007; 181(3):1086-1096.) though his technique was slightly different as he did not use the derivative, per se, but rather an approximation based on the fact that his function was a polynomial (though identical to the derivative). Raphson (1690) proposed the general form, hence the usual name of Newton-Raphson method.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Practice\n\nQuestion\nUsing Newton’s method to find \\(\\sqrt{k}\\) (by solving for roots of \\(f(x) = x^2 - k\\)) is also referred to as the Babylonian method, due to its origins. The resulting method\n\\[\nx_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \\frac{k}{x_n})\n\\]\nis described by the first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria.\nLet \\(k=15\\) and \\(x_0\\) be \\(4\\).

That is the method will converge, though perhaps not as fast as with the derivative.\n\n8.4.1 The secant method\nThe secant method is perhaps the oldest numerical linear algebra tool dating back over 3000 years well before Newton’s method. Rather than use the derivative at \\(x_i\\) to compute \\(x_{i+1}\\), the secant line is used between \\(x_{i-1}\\) and \\(x_i\\). This method will also converge to a zero with a good starting point, though not nearly as quickly as Newton’s method.\nYou can check – if you want – by repeating the last command until the change in x2 is within your tolerance:\n\nx2, x1 = 1, 2           # initial guess of 2\nf(x) = x^2 - 2          # some function\nfp(x1,x2) = (f(x1) - f(x2))/(x1 - x2)\nx2, x1 = x2 - f(x2)/fp(x1, x2), x2 # update step\n\n(1.3333333333333333, 1)\n\n\nWe can repeat via copy and paste:\n\nx2, x1 = x2 - f(x2)/fp(x1, x2), x2\nx2, x1 = x2 - f(x2)/fp(x1, x2), x2\nx2, x1 = x2 - f(x2)/fp(x1, x2), x2\nx2, x1 = x2 - f(x2)/fp(x1, x2), x2\nx2, x1 = x2 - f(x2)/fp(x1, x2), x2\n\nx2, f(x2)\n\n(1.4142135623730947, -8.881784197001252e-16)\n\n\nThe last line shows the algorithm has basically converged, as the values agree to \\(10^{-14}\\).

Here is an example to find \\(-\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\nf(x) = x^2 - 2\nfind_zero(f, -1)\n\n-1.414213562373095\n\n\n\n8.5.1 Using find_zero and a graph to find all roots.\nLet’s look, again, at the task of finding all zeros to the function \\(e^x - x^4\\). We follow a standard approach:\n\ngraph the function to roughly identify potential zeros\nuse these as starting points for find_zero to improve\n\nThe following graph suggests, perhaps, there may be \\(3\\) zeros, one near \\(9\\), one near \\(2\\) and one near \\(-1\\).\n\nf(x) = exp(x) - x^4\nplot(f, -5,9)\n\n\n\n\nWe can improve these guesses with\n\nfind_zero(f, 9), find_zero(f, 2), find_zero(f, -1)\n\n(8.6131694564414, 1.4296118247255556, -0.8155534188089607)\n\n\nThe above can be written without repeating find_zero by using a comprehension:\n\n[find_zero(f, x) for x in [9, 2, -1]]\n\n3-element Vector{Float64}:\n  8.6131694564414\n  1.4296118247255556\n -0.8155534188089607\n\n\nOr even more compactly, using the broadcast notation:\n\nfind_zero.(f, [-1, 2, 9])\n\n3-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.8155534188089607\n  1.4296118247255556\n  8.6131694564414\n\n\n\nAs another illustration, let \\(f(x) = \\cos^2(x^2)\\) on \\([-1,2]\\).

When the derivative at \\(\\alpha\\) is non-zero, the error is basically a constant times \\(\\Delta x_i^2\\).

This gives the satisfying answer that among all rectangles of fixed perimeter, that with the largest area is a square.\nBefore moving on, let’s see a slightly different way to do this problem, where we trade off some algebra for a bit of abstraction. Let’s first write area as a function of both base and height:\n\nA(b, h) = b*h\n\nA (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThen from the constraint given by the perimeter being a fixed value we can solve for h in terms of b. We write this as a function:\n\nh(b) = (20 - 2b) / 2\n\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThen to get A(b) we simply need to substitute h(b) into our formula for the area, A. However, instead of doing the substitution ourselves using algebra we let julia do it through composition of functions:\n\nA(b) = A(b, h(b))\n\nA (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nFrom this we can solve as before. This approach exploits julia’s multiple dispatch feature to reduce the need for sometimes unwieldy algebra.\n\n9.2.1 Norman Windows\nHere is a similar, though more complicated, example where the analytic approach can be a bit more tedious, but the graphical one mostly satisfying, though we do use the find_zero function to find the exact final answer.\nLet a “Norman” window consist of a rectangular window of top length \\(x\\) and side length \\(y\\) and a half circle on top. The goal is to maximize the area for a fixed value of the perimeter. Again, assume this perimeter is 20 units.\n\n\n\nNorman window\n\n\nThen we have two equations.\nThe area is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the half circle (\\(\\pi r^2/2\\)).\n\\[\nA = xy + \\pi(x/2)^2/2\n\\]\nIn julia this is\n\nA(x,y) = x*y + pi*(x/2)^2 / 2\n\nA (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThe perimeter consists of 3 sides of the rectangle and the perimeter of half a circle (\\(\\pi r\\), with \\(r=x/2\\)):\n\\[\nP = 2y + x + \\pi(x/2) = 20\n\\]\nWe solve for \\(y\\) in the first with \\(y = (20 - x - \\pi(x/2))/2\\) so that in julia we have:\n\ny(x) = (20 - x - pi * x/2) / 2\n\ny (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nAnd then we substitute in y(x) for y in the area formula through:\n\nA(x) = A(x, y(x))\n\nA (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nOf course both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are non-negative. The latter forces \\(x\\) to be no more than \\(20/(1+\\pi/2)\\).\nThis leaves us the calculus problem of finding an absolute maximum of a continuous function over the closed interval \\([0, 20/(1+\\pi/2)]\\). Our theorem tells us this maximum must occur, we now proceed to find it.\nWe begin by simply graphing and estimating the values of the maximum and where it occurs.\n\nplot(A, 0, 20/(1+pi/2))\n\n\n\n\nThe naked eye sees that maximum value is somewhere around \\(27\\) and occurs at \\(x\\approx 5.6\\). Clearly from the graph, we know the maximum value happens at the critical point and there is only one such critical point.\nAs reading the maximum from the graph is more difficult than reading a \\(0\\) of a function, we plot the derivative using our approximate derivative.\n\nplot(A', 5.5, 5.7)     # uses A' notation defined in MTH229\n\n\n\n\nWe confirm that the critical point is around \\(5.6\\).\n\n\n9.2.2 Using find_zero to locate critical points.\nRather than zoom in graphically, we now use a root-finding algorithm, to find a more precise value. We know that the maximum will occur at a critical point, a zero of the derivative. Newton’s method, for example, can locate the precise values of these zeros. The find_zero function from the Roots package provides a non-linear root-finding algorithm similar to Newton’s method. The only thing to keep track of is that solving \\(f'(x) = 0\\) means we use the derivative and not the original function.\nOur initial guess will be taken from the graph we made, or \\(x=5.6\\). Here is how we use find_zero:\n\nx = find_zero(A', 5.6)\n\n5.600991535115575\n\n\nThe value x is the critical point, and in this case gives the position of the value that will maximize the function. This value is sometimes referred to as the argmax, or argument which maximizes the function. The value and maximum area is then given by:\n\n(x, A(x))\n\n(5.600991535115575, 28.00495767557787)\n\n\n(Compare this answer to the previous, is the square the figure of greatest area for a fixed perimeter, or just the figure amongst all rectangles?)\n\n\n9.2.3 Practice\n\nQuestion\nA rancher with 20 meters of fence, wishes to make a pen adjacent to an existing fence. The pen will be a rectangle with one edge using the existing fence. Say that has length \\(x\\), then \\(20 = 2y + x\\), with \\(y\\) the other dimension of the pen.

Here is an example, the “ladder corner problem.” (There are many other ladder problems.\nA ladder is to be moved through a two-dimensional hallway which has a bend and gets narrower after the bend. The hallway is 8 feet wide then 5 feet wide. What is the longest such ladder that can be navigated around the corner? The figure shows a ladder of length \\(l_1 + l_2\\) that got stuck – it was too long.\n\n\n\nLadder\n\n\nWe approach this problem in reverse. It is easy to see when a ladder is too long. It gets stuck at some angle \\(\\theta\\). So for each \\(\\theta\\) we find that ladder length that is just too long. Then we find the minimum length of all these ladders that are too long. If a ladder is this length or more it will get stuck for some angle. However, if it is less than this length it will not get stuck. So to maximize a ladder length, we minimize a different function. Neat.\nNow, to find the length \\(l = l_1 + l_2\\) as a function of \\(\\theta\\).\nWe need to brush off our trigonometry, in particular right triangle trigonometry. We see from the figure that \\(l_1\\) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with opposite side \\(8\\) and \\(l_2\\) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with adjacent side \\(5\\). So, \\(8/l_1 = \\sin\\theta\\) and \\(5/l_2 = \\cos\\theta\\).\nThat is, we have\n\nl(l1, l2) = l1 + l2\nl1(t) = 8/sin(t)\nl2(t) = 5/cos(t)\n##\nl(t) = l(l1(t), l2(t))      # or simply l(t) = 8/sin(t) + 5/cos(t)\n\nl (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nOur goal is to minimize this function for all angles between \\(0\\) and \\(90\\) degrees, or \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi/2\\) radians.\nThis is not a continuous function on a closed interval – it is undefined at the endpoints.

(We use metric units, as the relationship between volume (cubic centimeters) and fluid amount (ml) is clear.) A can to hold this amount is produced in the shape of cylinder with radius \\(r\\) and height \\(h\\). The materials involved give the surface area, which would be:\n\\[\nSA = h \\cdot 2\\pi r + 2 \\cdot \\pi r^2\n\\]\nThe volume satisfies:\n\\[\nV = 355 = h \\cdot \\pi r^2\n\\]\nFind the values of \\(r\\) and \\(h\\) which minimize the surface area.\nFirst the surface area in both variables is given by\n\nSA(h, r) = h * 2pi * r + 2pi * r^2\n\nSA (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nAnd solving from the constraint on the volume for h in terms of r we have\n\nh(r) = 355 / (pi * r^2)\n\nh (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nAnd composing gives us a function of r alone:\n\nSA(r) = SA(h(r), r)\n\nSA (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nThis we minimize subject to the constraint that \\(r \\geq 0\\). A quick glance shows that as \\(r\\) gets close to \\(0\\), the can must get infinitely tall to contain that fixed volume, and would have infinite surface area as the \\(1/r^2\\) in the first term implies. On the other hand, as \\(r\\) goes to infinity, the height must go to 0 to make a really flat can. Again, we would have infinite surface area, as the \\(r^2\\) term at the end indicates. With this observation, we can rule out the endpoints as possible minima, so any minima must occur at a critical point.\nWe start by making a graph, making an educated guess that the answer is somewhere near a real life answer, or around 3-5 cms in radius:\n\nplot(SA, 2, 10)\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum looks to be around 4cm.

A video showing such a problem along with how to do it analytically is here.\nThis video starts with a simple question:\n\nIf you have a rope and heavy ring, where will the ring position itself due to gravity?\n\nWell, suppose you hold the rope in two places, which we can take to be \\((0,0)\\) and \\((a,b)\\). Then let \\((x,y)\\) be all the possible positions of the ring that hold the rope taught. Then we have this picture:\n\n\n\nString\n\n\nSince the length of the rope does not change, we must have for any admissible \\((x,y)\\) that:\n\\[\nL = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + \\sqrt{(a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2},\n\\]\nwhere these are the two hypotenuses in the figure, as computed through Pythagorean’s theorem.\n\nIf we assume that the ring will minimize the value of y subject to this constraint, can we solve for y?\n\nWell, with implicit differentiation you would regard \\(y=y(x)\\), implicitly differentiate and find the critical point of \\(y\\). Though messy to solve, the video shows a fundamental relationship which is a restatement of the reflection properties of ellipses.\nHere we show how we can do this numerically with julia. We don’t really have an easy way to work with implicit functions in julia, so we have some work to do to find an explicit function.\nFirst, lets assume \\(a=1\\) and \\(L=10\\) (\\(L\\) must be at least \\(\\sqrt{1 + b^2}\\)) , then we have:\n\na = 1; Len = 10\nf(x, y, a, b) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) + sqrt((a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2)\n\nf (generic function with 2 methods)\n\n\nNow we solve for a value of \\(b\\), say \\(b=1\\). You could choose other values for \\(b\\), as long as \\(L\\) is long enough.\n\nb = 1;               ## some arbitrary choice for b\nf(x, y) = f(x, y, a, b)\n\nf (generic function with 3 methods)\n\n\nOur values \\((x,y)\\) must satisfy \\(f(x,y) = L\\) so for a fixed \\(x\\), \\(y\\) must be a zero of the function:\n\\[\nh(y) = f(x, y) - L = 0\n\\]\nThat is, if we start with \\(x\\) and solve this equation for \\(y\\) the resulting value \\((x,y)\\) will be on the curve. Call this function \\(g\\). We can define it with:\n\nfunction g(x)\n   h(y) = f(x, y) - Len\n   find_zero(h, zero(x))  # not 0, but zero(x) to get type right\nend\n\ng (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nLet’s see if it worked. For \\(x=0.4\\) we get that \\(y\\) is\n\ng(0.4)\n\n-4.4746883945649625\n\n\nAnd furthermore, we have\n\nf(.4, g(0.4))\n\n10.0\n\n\nThat this is \\(L\\), should be the case for any choice of \\(x\\) when we have convergence for \\(g\\). Try it yourself with a different value in \\([0,1]\\).\nNow, through this inversion trick, we have a function \\(y=g(x)\\). We graph to see that indeed this function will have a minimum value:\n\nplot(g, 0.2, 0.8)\n\n\n\n\n(The implicit function theorem will tell us that locally for any \\(x\\) we can find a function to return \\(y\\) provided a certain derivative is not \\(0\\) and the equation is reasonably behaved.)\nOkay, now to find the lowest point. This is what we minimize to find the resting position of the ring. Again, we turn to find_zero, but for minimization we use the first derivative, as we are finding critical points.\n\nx = find_zero(g', (0.3, 0.6))\n\n0.44974810923703934\n\n\n(The above only works due to how we defined g using zero(x) and not 0 for technical reasons related to automatic differentiation.)\nThe point where the ring rests is:\n\nx, g(x)\n\n(0.44974810923703934, -4.4749371855331)\n\n\nIf you watch the video linked to above, you will see that the surprising fact here is the resting point is such that the angles formed by the rope are the same. Basically this makes the tension in both parts of the rope equal, so there is a static position (if not static, the ring would move and not end in the final position). We can verify this fact numerically by showing the arctangents of the two triangles are the same:\n\nt = g(x)\natan(abs(t)/x) - atan((b-t)/(a-x))\n\n0.0\n\n\nNow, were we lucky and just happened to take \\(b = 1\\) in such a way to make this work?

The area under the graph of \\(f(x)\\) is given by the definite integral:\n\\[\n\\text{Area under f} = \\int_a^b f(x) dx\n\\]\nComputing this area is often made easier with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus which states in one form that one can compute a definite integral through knowledge of an antiderivative. In particular, if \\(F(x)\\) is an antiderivative for \\(f(x)\\), a continuous function, then\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a).\n\\]\nThis is great as long as some antiderivative is known. There are several different techniques for finding antiderivatives. The integrate function in the SymPy package can do many of them:\nusing MTH229\nusing Plots\n\nf(x) = x^3 - cos(x) + x*log(x)\n@syms x\nintegrate(f(x), x)\n\n \n\\[\n\\frac{x^{4}}{4} + \\frac{x^{2} \\log{\\left(x \\right)}}{2} - \\frac{x^{2}}{4} - \\sin{\\left(x \\right)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTo find the definite integral, say from \\(1\\) to \\(10\\) we have:\n\nintegrate(f(x), (x, 1, 10))\n\n \n\\[\n- \\sin{\\left(10 \\right)} + \\sin{\\left(1 \\right)} + 50 \\log{\\left(10 \\right)} + 2475\n\\]\n\n\n\nIf all functions had antiderivatives that could be found symbolically, there wouldn’t be much more to say. However, it is a fact of life that not all nice functions will have an antiderivative in a convenient form. A test for such functions is provided in Risch’s algorithm. In cases where no workable antiderivative is available, the above approach is of no help. Rather, to find the area one can turn to numeric approximations that progressively get better as more approximations are taken.\nOne such approximation is given by the familiar Riemann sums, which we will look at here. However, the problem of trying to find the area of geometric figures did not start with Riemann some 150 years ago, indeed it has a much longer history. In the time of Pythagorus the idea of calculating area was one of being able to construct a square of equal area to a figure. This was known as quadrature. Finding such answers for figures bounded by curves was difficult, though Archimedes effectively computed the area under \\(f(x) = x^2\\) about 2,000 years before Riemann sums using triangles, not rectangles to approximate the area. By medieval Europe, the term quadrature evolved to be the computation of an area by any means. For example, Galileo and Roberval found the area bounded by a cycloid arch. Along the way, other approximations were used. We will see those due to Simpson and Gauss, both predating Riemann."

    "text": "10.2 Riemann sums\nIn 1854 Riemann was the first to give a rigorous definition of the integral of a continuous function on a closed interval, the problem we wish to solve here, using the concept of a Riemann sum. A Riemann sum is one of the simplest to understand approximations to the area under a curve. The basic idea is that the interval \\([a,b]\\) is partitioned through points \\(a = x_0 < x_1 < \\cdots x_n = b\\) and the area under \\(f(x)\\) between \\(x_i\\) and \\(x_{i+1}\\) is approximated by a rectangle with the base \\(x_{i+1} - x_i\\) and height given by \\(f(x_i^*)\\), where \\(x_i^*\\) is some point in the interval \\([x_i, x_{i+1}]\\). Typical choices are the left point or the right point of the interval, or the \\(x\\) value which minizes or maximizes \\(f\\) over the interval. The figure shows these four choices for some sample function. For a Riemann integrable function, such as a continuous function on \\([a,b]\\), any of the choices will yield the same value as the partition’s mesh shrinks to \\(0\\).\n\n\n\nRiemann\n\n\nAs with other limits, we can numerically approximate the limit by computing the Riemann sum for some partition. The steps for this include:\n\ncreating a partition of \\([a,b]\\). We will use evenly spaced points for convenience.\nSelecting the \\(x_i^*\\) within the partition\nComputing the values \\(f(x_i^*)(x_{i+1} - x_i)\\) for each \\(i\\)\nadding these values up\n\nIf we partition \\([a,b]\\) into \\(n\\) same sized intervals, then each has length \\(\\delta = (b-a)/n\\) and so the points are separated by this amount. As such, we can choose our \\(a = x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_n = b\\) with commands like:\n\na, b, n = 1, 3, 5;\ndelta = (b-a)/n;\nxs = a .+ (0:n) * delta\n\n1.0:0.4:3.0\n\n\nTo apply a function to a range of values, we may use a map, a comprehension, a for loop or the “dot” notation.

The value of using rectangles over a grid to approximate area is for theoretical computations, for numeric computations better approximations were known well before Riemann. We mention a few:\n\nThe trapezoid rule and Simpson’s rule approximate the area under the curve better, as instead of a rectangle they use a trapezoid (linear fit between two points) or a quadratic fit between the two points.)\nGauss quadrature uses non-evenly selected points within the range and a weighting which is exact for polynomials of a given degree.\nAdaptive methods pick a non-uniform set of points to use based on where a function is less well behaved.\n\n\n10.4.1 Trapezoid and Simpson’s rule\nThe trapezoid rule simply replaces the approximation of the area in a subinterval by a trapezoid, as opposed to a rectangle.\nWe can use this as follows.

That is, replace the function with the secant line between these two values and integrate the replacement. With this viewpoint, it is possible that other easy-to-integrate function approximations will lead to improved approximate integrals. Simpson’s method can be viewed in just this way. It replaces \\(f\\) by the parabola going through \\((a, f(a))\\), \\((c, f( c))\\) and \\((b, f(b))\\) where \\(c=(a+b)/2\\) is the midpoint between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\nWe compare how accurate we get with this rule for the same f as before:\n\nsimpsons_r = [riemann(f, 0, 1, n, method=\"simpsons\") for n in ns];\n[ns (1).-left_r (1).-trapezoid_r (1).-simpsons_r]\n\n5×4 Matrix{Float64}:\n     10.0  -0.26665      -0.01665      -4.16667e-6\n    100.0  -0.0251667    -0.000166665  -4.16667e-10\n   1000.0  -0.00250167   -1.66667e-6   -4.15223e-14\n  10000.0  -0.000250017  -1.66667e-8    1.22125e-15\n 100000.0  -2.50002e-5   -1.66664e-10   1.22125e-15\n\n\nAs can be seen, for this function approximating with a parabola is much quicker to converge. That is, \\(n\\) can be smaller yet the same accuracy is maintained. (Of course, there are more computations involved for each, so the number of operations needed may or may not be fewer, that would require some analysis.)\n\n\n10.4.3 Error\nIt can be shown that the error for Simpson’s method is bounded by\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{90}\\frac{1}{2^5} M (b-a)^5 \\frac{1}{n^4},\n\\]\nwhere \\(M\\) is a bound on the fourth derivative.

(That is, the function is not continuous, so has no guarantee that an integral over a closed domain exists.) However, some such integrals do exist, and the quadgk function can integrate around such singularities by spelling them out in the domain of integration. Just specify the trouble spots between the endpoints:\nf(x) = abs(x - 0.3)^(-1/4)\nval = quadgk(f, 0, 0.3, 1);\nFollowing the above, what answer do you get?"

    "text": "10.6 Applications\nThere are many more applications of the integral beyond computing areas under the curve. Here we discuss two:\n\nfinding the volume of a figure with rotational symmetry (a glass in our example) and\nfinding the arc length of a line.\n\nIn each case one integrates a function related to the one describing the problem. If you keep this straight, the applications are no different than above.\n\n10.6.1 Volume as a function of radius.\nThe volume of a solid of revolution about the \\(y\\)-axis is illustrated here.\nThis figure shows a volume of revolution (a glass) with an emphasis on the radius of the solid. The volume can be determined if the radius is known.\n\n\n\nGlass\n\n\nThe basic formula requires the description of the radius as a function of \\(x\\) (if oriented as the figure) or the height, \\(h\\), (if oriented as in real life). Suppose we specify the radius with \\(r(h)\\), then the following formula holds with \\(b\\) the total height.\n\\[\nV(b) = \\int_0^b \\pi r(h)^2 dh.\n\\]\nFor a symmetrical drinking vessel, like most every glass you drink from, the volume can be computed from a formula if a function describing the radius is known. For a given glass, let \\(r(h)\\) give the radius as a function of height. Then, as above, the volume of the vessel as a function of height, \\(b\\), is given by an integral:\n\\[\nV(b) = \\int_0^b \\pi (r(h))^2 dh\n\\]\nWe wish to look at our intuition relating the height of the fluid in the vessel compared to the percentage of fluid of the whole. A basic question might be: If the vessel is filled half way by height, is the volume half of the total, more or less?\nThe answer, of course, depends on the shape of the glass. That is the shape of the function \\(r(h)\\). Note, if \\(r(h)\\) is a constant – the glass is a cylinder – then the half-height mark is also the half-volume mark. Not so in general.\nFor a standard measuring cup, the answer for different b’s is printed on the side:\n\n\n\nMeasuring cup\n\n\nWith the formula for the volume of a solid of revolution we can compute this marks numerically if we know the radius as a function of height.\nIn Glass Shape Influences Consumption Rate for Alcoholic Beverages the authors demonstrate that the shape of the glass can have an effect on the rate of consumption, presumably people drink faster when they aren’t sure how much they have left. In particular, they comment that people have difficulty judging the half-finished-by-volume mark.\nThis figure shows some of the wide variety of beer-serving glasses:\nBeer glasses\nWe work with metric units, as there is a natural relation between volume in cm\\(^3\\) and liquid measure (1 liter = 1000 cm\\(^3\\), so a 16-oz pint glass is roughly \\(450\\) cm\\(^3\\).)\nLet two glasses be given as follows. A typical pint glass with linearly increasing radius:\n\\[\nr(h) = 3 + \\frac{1}{5}h, \\quad 0 \\leq h \\leq b;\n\\]\nand a curved edge one:\n\\[\ns(h) = 3 + \\log(1 + h), \\quad 0 \\leq h \\leq b\n\\]\nHalf full\nOne could also consider a fluted one, such as appears in the comparison noted in the article.\n\nQuestion\nWhich of these functions might describe a fluted glass where the radius changes faster as the height gets bigger, that is the radius is a concave up function?\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n        r(h) = 2 + sqrt(x/10), 0 <= x <= 10\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        r(h) = 2 + (x/10)^2, 0 <= x <= 10\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      \n        r(h) = 2 + x/10, 0 <= x <= 10\n      \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the two types of glasses in the figure, we create functions in julia as follows:\n\nr(h) = 3 + h/5\ns(h) = 2 + log(1 + h)\nr_vol(b) = quadgk(x -> pi*r(x)^2, 0, b)[1]\ns_vol(b) = quadgk(x -> pi*s(x)^2, 0, b)[1]\n\ns_vol (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThen we can easily find the volume as a function of height. For example at 10cm we have:\n\n(r_vol(10), s_vol(10))\n\n(513.1268000863329, 427.26481657392833)\n\n\nHowever, to find \\(b\\) that makes the glass \\(450\\) cm\\(^3\\) requires us to solve an equation involving an integral for \\(b\\):\n\\[\nV(b) = \\int_0^b \\pi r(h)^2 dh = 450.\n\\]\nNot to worry, we can use find_zero from the Roots package for that (again, this is loaded with the MTH229 package). To solve for when V(b) = r_vol(b) - 450 = 0 we have\n\nr_b = find_zero(x -> r_vol(x) - 450,  10)\n\n9.168923214523724\n\n\nSo \\(b\\) is basically \\(9.17\\).

    "text": "10.7 Example, arc length\nThe basic indefinite integral for a positive function answers the amount of area under the curve over a given interval. However, the integral can be interpreted in many different ways. For example, one can use an integral to answer how long a curve is. Of course one can estimate this answer. For example, consider this curve:\n\nplot(x -> x^2, 0, 1)\n\n\n\n\nThis curve has length no more than \\(2 = 1 + 1\\) – the distance along the \\(x\\) axis starting at \\(0\\) to \\(1\\) and then going up. It is also longer than \\(\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}\\) – the straight line distance between the two endpoints. But how long is it?\nIn general, the arc length of the curve \\(y=f(x)\\) between \\(a \\leq x \\leq b\\) (or how long is the curve) is given through the formula\n\\[\nl = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2} dx\n\\]\nThe formula is from the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with lengths \\(1\\) and \\(f'(x)\\), This image suggests an approximation for the length and why the hypotenuse of some triangle might be involved.\nArc length\nRather than focus on a derivation, we do some examples illustrating that to compute the arclength of the graph of a function is relatively straightforward using numeric integration. For example, our answer for \\(f(x) = x^2\\) is given by\n\nf(x) = x^2\nquadgk(x -> sqrt(1 + f'(x)^2), 0, 1)      # using f' notation defined in MTH229\n\n(1.4789428575446002, 1.0424396901242972e-8)\n\n\n(We use an anonymous function for the integrand which involved the derivative being found through f'. If the graph is described by f, then this expression be the same for all these problems.)\n\nWhereas, the length of the \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) over \\([0, \\pi]\\) would be:\n\nf(x) = sin(x)\nquadgk(x -> sqrt(1 + f'(x)^2), 0, pi)\n\n(3.820197789027713, 9.377002729848982e-9)\n\n\nNext we look at a more practical problem.\n\n10.7.1 Example: the caternary shape\nA caternary shape is the shape a hanging chain will take as it is suspended between two posts.

The basic dimensions are 78in wide and 118in drop. If our shifted function is\n\\[\nf(x; a, b) = a \\cosh(x/a) - b\n\\]\nThen we have \\(f(0) = -118\\) and \\(f(78/2) = 0\\) using the origin midway between the two tops of the curve. Solving the first gives\n\\[\n-118 = a - b \\text{ or } b = a + 118.\n\\]\nThe second gives \\(a \\cdot \\cosh(78/(2a)) - (a + 118) = 0\\).

    "text": "10.8 Gauss quadrature, Using weights\nWhat components go into the quadgk function? This section covers some of the background.\nThe trapezoid rule can be rearranged to become:\n\\[\n\\delta f(x_0) + 2\\delta f(x_2) + 2 \\delta f(x_3) + \\cdots + 2 \\delta f(x_{n}) + \\delta f(x_{n})\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta = (b-a)/n\\).\nWhereas for even \\(n\\), Simpson’s rule can be written with:\n\\[\n\\delta f(x_0) + 4\\delta f(x_1) + 2 \\delta f(x_2) + \\cdots +  4 \\delta f(x_{n-2}) + 2 \\delta f(x_{n-1}) + \\delta f(x_{n})\n\\]\nwith \\(\\delta = (b-a)/n \\cdot (1/6)\\).\nThese both have the general form of\n\\[\n\\sum_k w_k \\cdot f(x_k)\n\\]\nwhere \\(w_k\\) are weights and the \\(x_k\\) some choice of points (nodes) – not necessarily evenly spaced, though that is so in the examples we’ve seen. So, an alternative way to do the trapezoid formula in julia for \\(n=4\\) might be:\n\na, b, n = 0, 1, 4\ndelta = (b-a)/n\nf(x) = x^2\nwts = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] * delta ## delta * [1, repeat([2],n-1), 1]'\nxs = a .+ (0:n) * delta\nsum(w * f(x) for (w,x) in zip(wts, xs))\n\n0.6875\n\n\nThe compact code of the last line to compute the approximate integral shows there are three important things in this form of the integral: the weights, the nodes or \\(x\\) values, and the function. The use of equally spaced nodes has been used by us so far, but it need not be the case. If fact Gauss showed he could get similar answers faster if it wasn’t the case.\nThe Gauss nodes and weights are computable (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature). The main tools are the so-called Legendre polynomials, which can be defined recursively with Bonnet’s formula:\n\\[\nP_0(x) = 1; P_1(x) = x; \\quad  n P_{n}(x)  = (2(n-1)+1) x P_{n-1}(x) -(n-1) P_{n-2}(x).\n\\]\nUsing julia’s Polynomials package this can be implemented almost verbatim:\n\nimport Polynomials\nimport Polynomials: Polynomial\nfunction lgp(n::Integer)\n    if n == 0 return Polynomial([1]) end\n    if n == 1 return Polynomial([0, 1]) end\n\n    (2*(n-1) + 1) / n * lgp(1) * lgp(n-1) - (n-1)/n * lgp(n-2)\nend\n\nlgp (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nThis is used as,\n\np4 = lgp(4)\n\n0.375 - 3.75∙x2 + 4.375∙x4\n\n\nThe term recursion is applied to a function when it makes a reference to itself during a computation. With this function, don’t try it with values much bigger than \\(20\\), as the recursion can take a long time.\nThe nodes are the roots of the right polynomial. Here we have the values for p4\n\nxs = Polynomials.roots(p4)\n\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n -0.8611363115940536\n -0.33998104358485653\n  0.3399810435848563\n  0.8611363115940531\n\n\n(The Konrod part of quadgk changes the nodes so they can be reused during the refinement.)\nFinally, the weights involve the derivative of \\(P_n\\) through:\n\\[\nw_i = \\frac{2}{(1 - x_i^2) \\cdot(P^{'}_n(x_i)/P_n(1))^2}\n\\]\nThese can be done simply with:\n\nweights(x) = 2 / ((1 - x^2) * (Polynomials.derivative(p4)(x)/p4(1))^2 )\nws = [weights(xi) for xi in xs]\n\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.3478548451374517\n 0.6521451548625461\n 0.6521451548625463\n 0.3478548451374526\n\n\nFrom here gauss_quadrature will do the integration of f over the interval \\([-1,1]\\), though we can do it ourself quickly enough. Here we compute the integral of \\(\\cos(\\pi/2 x)\\) over \\([-1,1]\\) (you can check this is very close to the answer \\(4/\\pi\\) even with just 4 nodes):\nf(x) = cos(pi/2*x)\nsum(w * f(x) for (w,x) in zip(ws, xs))\n\n10.8.1 Adaptive integration\nNext, we a have a brief discussion about an alternative means to compute integrals. The following function adapt implements a basic adaptive quadrature method for integration. The basic idea is that for a subinterval \\([a,b]\\) if the area of the trapezoid is not close to the area of Simpson’s parabolic estimate then the subinterval is split into two pieces \\([a,c]\\) and \\([c,b]\\) and the same question is asked. If the area is close the Simpson’s parabolic estimate is used to estimate the integral of \\(f\\) over that subinterval.\nAgain, we see recursion when programming this algorithm. To avoid infinite loops during this, we use a limit below to keep track.\nIn general, the value of adaptive methods like this, is the function calls concentrate on areas where \\(f\\) is not well approximated and where it is well approximated it just moves on. This approach works well for poorly behaved functions, as it has a more refined grid there.\n\nfunction adapt(f, a, b, limit)\n\n    h = b-a\n    c = a + (b - a)/2\n\n    a1 = (f(a) + f(b)) * h/2          ## trapezoid\n    a2 = (f(a) + 4f(c) + f(b)) * h/6  ## Simpson's parabola\n\n    if isapprox(a1, a2)\n        return(a2)\n    end\n\n    if limit == 0\n        println(\"limit reached for this interval [$a, $b]\")\n    return(a2)\n    end\n\n    adapt(f, a, c, limit - 1) + adapt(f, c, b, limit-1)\nend\n\nadapt (generic function with 1 method)\n\n\nDoes it work? Let’s see it for the area of \\(f(x) = x^2(1-x)^{10}\\) which is known to satisfy \\(\\beta(2+1, 10+1)\\)\nout = adapt(x -> x^2 * (1 -x)^10, 0, 1, 10)\nNot too far off (1e-10) from the known answer which is a beta function:\nout - beta(2 + 1, 10 + 1)\n(The use of isapprox above determines how accurate the values will be. This function uses two tolerances to test if the valus x and y are approximately the same. These could be changed easily enough so that more precise answers can be found.)"
